            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO Sir <hi>Thomas Millington,</hi> Kt. Preſident of the Colledge of Phyſicians of <hi>London,</hi> and Phyſician in Ordinary to his Majeſty.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe Honourable Poſt, which you ſo worthily fill, gives a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Title to your Protection to this Piece, which is the Hiſtory of the firſt Riſe, and earlieſt advances of that Faculty, which You ſo nobly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend in its declining Age. I call tt the declining Age of Phyſick, not from any decay that I obſerve in its Intellects, which perhaps are more vigorous and lively now than ever, but from a formidable Conjunction, which ſeems at this time to threaten the Overthrow of its Conſtitution,
<pb facs="tcp:54988:3"/>eſpecially here in <hi>England.</hi> The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Colledge of Phyſicians, the nobleſt Branch that ever Phyſick bore, has been attempted not only by the open Aſſaults of its Profeſs'd Enemies, but likewiſe by the ſecret Machinations of ſome of its treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous corrupt Members, whoſe unge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Deſigns have been mainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by your Prudence, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken Reſolution.</p>
            <p>Quacks have been coaevous to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick itſelf; we meet with no Memoirs of a date early enough to ſhew us an Age unmoleſted with that raſcally ſort of Vermin. But to proſtitute a liberal Education to the baſeſt of Submiſſions, and to ſtoop an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Profeſſion to diſingenuous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, only to gain the favour and recommendation of a Pack of illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Mechanicks, is an honour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd for our Age and Country, where Intereſt tyrannizes, and men are too impatient to wait the ſlow advances of Honeſty or Merit, to be rich or great.</p>
            <p>It may ſeem ſtrange to thoſe that have not pierc'd to the bottom of this Myſtery, that men ſhou'd endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſubvert the Honour, and
<pb facs="tcp:54988:3"/>trample upon the Dignity of that Faculty, by the exerciſe of which they themſelves aim to riſe. But there is no Riddle in the matter; They have found out a ſhorter cut to Reputation than by Learning and Skill, which require Induſtry and Application; they ſteer their courſe altogether by Craft and Intrigue. They are refining upon the Policy of the Mountebanks; For they plainly ſee the Figure which the Doctor makes with the People is owing to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Fool, that recommends him. For this reaſon they endeavour to deſtroy a Society, whoſe Laws and Conſtitutions are a ſevere curb to all ſuch mean indirect Practices, and which allow its Members no other methods of making their court to the world, than thoſe of Juſtice and Charity; which latter theſe men have as much as in 'em lay endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to obſtruct. Of this the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice now erected at the Colledge for the relief of the Poor is a ſufficient Evidence; and in ſpight of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of its Enemies, or the Iniquity of the Times, will, I hope, prove a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Monument to your Honour, and
<pb facs="tcp:54988:4"/>procure you the hearty reſpect, and thanks of all good men, as it does of,</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THe work, by many ſo much wiſh'd for, and ſo long deſir'd, is I hope by this time pretty far advanc'd. Mr <hi>Le Clerc</hi> has in this firſt Volume, which is ſent to prepare us for a better reception of thoſe that are to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, given us ſuch a Specimen of his skill and exactneſs, that we have reaſon to expect with Impatience the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of his Promiſe. A work of this nature carries ſo much difficulty, and ſo little Profit to the Undertaker, that few have the Ability requiſite for ſuch a Task, and fewer the Courage to engage in a Service ſo hard, for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſo ſmall, and ſo precarious as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. For, tho Reputation be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt univerſally courted, 'tis for the ſake of Popularity, and Preferment, which are ſuppos'd to attend it.</p>
            <p>For this reaſon perhaps it is, that the <hi>Hiſtory of Phyſick</hi> has been ſo much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in this Age, that has with ſuch wonderful Induſtry and Succeſs, cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb facs="tcp:54988:5"/>and carry'd on this Science in all its Branches. The duty of a Hiſtorian obliges him to be juſt to others, and to aſſert their honour who deſerve it, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſoever to his own Intereſt, or Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, a thing directly repugnant to the general humour of the World, who affect to found their own Names upon the ruine of other men's, and think eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that hears well in the oppoſite Scale to themſelves, and conſequently that their only way to riſe is by depreſſing others.</p>
            <p>But whether this perverſe, malevolent Temper, a diſeaſe as common to, and as hard to be cur'd in Phyſicians as other men, indiſpos'd 'em for a work ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, as the recording the Merits and Services of others, without any Proſpect of reward to themſelves for their labour: Or whether the general Application to the Improvement of the Art or Science itſelf, might make 'em neglect an enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which they might think brought no real acceſſion of knowledge to it: Or laſtly, whether the reaſonable care which ev'ry man might lawfully have of his own Intereſt, diverted 'em from a Study, which, giving no reputation of Practical Skill, was not likely to be attended with Profit; this uſeful enquiry lay dormant above fourteen hundred years, nothing conſiderable having been done in it from the time of <hi>Galen</hi> to our Author, that I know of.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:54988:5"/>
            <p>In the year 1611, <hi>Michael Doringius,</hi> a <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Profeſſor of Phyſick in the Univerſity of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> publiſhed a piece <hi>de Medicina &amp; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis,</hi> in the firſt part of which he treats expreſsly, <hi>Of the Riſe, and Progreſs of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick;</hi> wherein he pretends to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Inventers and Improvers of Phyſick, and the ſeveral Sects into which the Profeſſors of it were ſplit, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided. But as our Author in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face rightly obſerves, this Book does by no means anſwer the Title. For, beſides ſome general hints concerning the Fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Age of Phyſick, looſely put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and a very ſlender account of the ſeveral ſorts of Antient Phyſicians incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently patch'd up from <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> he has very little to the purpoſe of his Title. His main aim was to curb and refute the extravagancies of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> whoſe hot-headed whimſical notions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan about that time to prevail very much in <hi>Germany.</hi> For <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> by his appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to Chymiſtry, (a ſtudy then not much in uſe) having made himſelf Maſter of ſome conſiderable Remedies, had part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his Cures, and partly by his prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Boaſting, gain'd ſuch an Aſcendant over the credulous Vulgar, and with them ſome not unlearned men, that ſeeing ſomething more than they expected, they fooliſhly believ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d more than was poſſible of him. This Succeſs, in conjunction with his natural Vanity, blew the man up ſo exceſſively, that he immediately
<pb facs="tcp:54988:6"/>laid claim to the Soveraignty of Phyſick and Philoſophy, ſet up for a new Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, and a new Sect, and with the true Spirit of an Enthuſiaſtick Reformer, very rudely and unjuſtly inſulted and vilify'd all the great men that preceded him in either Study, eſpecially <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.</hi> This Inſolence arm'd abundance of Volunteers againſt him, and engag'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers learned Pens on both ſides in the Controverſie, amongſt whom <hi>Doringius</hi> made one, whoſe Book <hi>de Medicina &amp; Medicis,</hi> whether we conſider the Matter, Method or Deſign of it, muſt be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as it really is, a Polemical, not a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Piece. For thoſe few Hiſtorical Remarks which he premiſes, ſeem rather to ſerve as an Introduction to his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to ſhew the Antiquity and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of the Sect, which he undertakes the defence of, than to make any part of the Original Deſign.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neander</hi> of <hi>Bremen</hi> ſeems to promiſe ſomething more perfect and compleat, (as our Author relates his deſign, or rather the Title of his Book.) But I have never ſeen this Book, as our Author likewiſe confeſſes he never had when he wrote his Preface, and therefore I can only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve concerning it, that this Piece cou'd afford our Author no Method, or Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the proſecution of his Excellent work hitherto.</p>
            <p>After theſe, the learned <hi>Conringius,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor at <hi>Helmſtadt,</hi> fell upon much the ſame Argument, which he treated of
<pb facs="tcp:54988:6"/>in ſeveral Lectures to his Scholars, and promis'd to publiſh compleat to the World, but was prevented by death. It was afterwards publiſh'd in Quarto, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Title of <hi>Hermanni Conringii Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductio ad univerſam Medicinam,</hi> with tedious Notes by <hi>Chriſtopher Schelhammer,</hi> his Scholar, and afterwards Profeſſor in the ſame Univerſity, which ſerve rather to ſwell the Bulk, than raiſe the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of his Author; and to make him more Voluminous, than Uſeful or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat. The whole Work is divided into ſeveral Chapters, or Lectures, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nature, Conſtitution, and Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Med'cine, or the Art of Phyſick, Of the Phyſick of the <hi>Aſclepiadean</hi> Family, and the ſeveral Antient Schools of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, Of the ſeveral Sects, and their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: The reſt of his Chapters he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon the ſeveral Members of the Faculty, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Phyſiology, Pathology, Pharmaceuticks, Semeioticks, Diaeteticks, Anatomy, Botany, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> each apart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in after a few ſlight hints of the uſe of 'em in general, he proceeds to ennumerate, and cenſure the Authors that have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of 'em, whether Antient or Modern</p>
            <p>Had this deſign been rightly and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proſecuted, 'tis probable our Author had been in great meaſure prevented. For tho the Method in which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed be very different, yet the matter wou'd have been in the main coincident. But whether <hi>Conringius,</hi> who perhaps in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended theſe Lectures only as private di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to his own Scholars, for the choice
<pb facs="tcp:54988:7"/>of Authors in the courſe of their ſtudies, who therefore might reſt ſatisfy'd in the ſingle Authority of their Maſter, did not think himſelf oblig'd to dilate on thoſe matters, or Authors, which he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to 'em, or cautioned 'em of; Or whether coming out after his Death from the Notes taken by his Scholars during his Reading, theſe Lectures were mutilated by a haſty tranſcription; Or, which at laſt 'tis moſt reaſonable to believe, that theſe Lectures were only Sketches of his deſign, rough Draughts of a Piece, which wou'd have made a very different Figure, had the Author liv'd to have filled up his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and given the Finiſhing Strokes; The view which he gives of the Phyſick of a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny Age or Perſons is very confus'd, ſhort, and imperfect, His Characters of Authors ſuperficial, arbitrary, and ſometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.</p>
            <p>Nor is his Performance much mended by the hevy labours of his Diſciple <hi>Schel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hammer,</hi> whoſe Partiality, and want of Judgment, abſolutely incapacitate him for the buſineſs of a Hiſtorian, or a Critick. His Paſſion for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> is moſt remarkable in him; they are his Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Philoſophy and Phyſick, without which the can't ſee any thing, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend how others ſhou'd. Upon this account he bears an irreconcileable grudge to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Phyſicians, particularly to Dr <hi>Willis,</hi> for not ſubmitting their Reaſon upon all occaſions to his two Oracles; and having us'd his own underſtanding to
<pb facs="tcp:54988:7"/>leading-ſtrings all his Life, he wonders at the Boldneſs and Preſumption of any one that dares truſt his to its own Legs. I ſuppoſe, we need no other line to fathom the depth of this Gentleman's capacity, and to aſſure us that no great burthens of Learning are like to reach us that way. But if we conſider his Favourites, the Cobweb Spinners upon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Galen;</hi> and the plundering Compilers of tedious <hi>Dutch</hi> Syſtems of Practice, which he values by the Bulk, we have no great reaſon to be ambitious of his Favour, but rather to take his cenſure for a Complement, and be proud of being out of his good Graces.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, and the Chronology of <hi>Wolfgangus Juſtus,</hi> (which our Author ſays he has not ſeen, tho in the fourth Book of this Volume in the Chapter of <hi>Diocles Caryſtius,</hi> he taxes him with a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miſtake) there are ſome other ſmall Pieces of <hi>Heurnius, Vanderlindan,</hi> &amp;c. which afford ſome ſcatter'd hints; but ſuch as are no bar to our Author's pretenſions, as the firſt that has regularly trod this Path, in which no continued traces appear to guide him.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not attempt to foreſtal the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Reader, with a tedious account of our Author's Performance and Merit on this account. But I muſt be ſo juſt to him, as without treſpaſſing upon any man's patience to obſerve, that Mr <hi>le Clerc</hi> is the firſt that has given us a diſtinct view of the ſtate of Phyſick in the fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Ages of the world. He has taken ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
<pb facs="tcp:54988:8"/>care to ſettle the age of the ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Inventers of it, and from a confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Traditions, abſurd, fabulous or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, ſo judiciouſly to extricate the truth, as with a great meaſure of certainty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to us no contemptible account of the growth, and encreaſe of Phyſick during thoſe dark times. As his light encreaſes, his proſpect clears up, and the ſecond Book gives us a ſuccinct, but a well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted account of the Progreſs of the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, under the management and cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Philoſophers, till the time of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> whoſe Reputation and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties grew to ſuch a heighth, as to overtop and obſcure all that went before him, and even to caſt a damp and a cloud up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Merits of all that have ſucceeded him for ſo many Ages to this day. His third Book is entirely taken up with the Hiſtory and Phyſick of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> which he has ſo far exhauſted, that ſcarce the works of that great man himſelf, can give us ſo juſt an Idea of his Merit and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. He has with great accuracy and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, diſtinguiſhed the genuine Works of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> from the ſpurious, and with as great Art and Judgment extracted a compendious Syſtem of the Philoſophy and Medicine of that Father of Phyſick. From whence, if we have not the means of ſurveying minutely all the particular paſſages and beauties of it, we have at leaſt the advantage of a more entire and uniform View, and may make a better Judgment of the whole. So that tho from
<pb facs="tcp:54988:8"/>thence we don't learn the practice of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> yet we may there ſee what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion we have for it, and be readily refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to any thing, which we ſhall think fit to examine more minutely. If therefore a work of this nature does not immediately make us able Phyſicians, it makes us bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Criticks, and conſequently t'other alſo, if we will imploy our Judgments for the enlargement of our Knowledge, and not perverſely abuſe it to ſnarl at one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The laſt Book of this Volume con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the account of the State of Phyſick, from <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to the Age of <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> in which nothing of moment occurs, except ſome few Innovations in <hi>Phyſiology</hi> by <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> no conſiderable Memoirs remaining to us of the Practice or Opinions of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd Phyſicians after <hi>Polybus</hi> the Son-in-law of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> till <hi>Chryſippus,</hi> who begins the next Volume.</p>
            <p>One thing I think my ſelf oblig'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Reader with, that neither the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor nor the other Gentlemen concern'd in this verſion, may be held reſponſible for errours, of which I perhaps alone am guilty; which is, that in tranſlating the firſt Book, I have taken the liberty to add ſome few Marginal Notes, which I thought of uſe to the Illuſtration of that part of the Hiſtory, and which I have therefore caus'd to be diſtinguiſh'd from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, which are referr'd to by Letters, as mine, by theſe marks * †.</p>
            <p>It may perhaps be further expected that I ſhould ſay ſomething according to cuſtom for myſelf, and the Gentlemen concerned
<pb facs="tcp:54988:9"/>with me in this Verſion, and apologize for what we have done. For my part, I ſee no reaſon for't; if we have done our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor juſtice, an Apology is altogether unneceſſary; if not, 'tis inſignificant. We have thrown away our pains, as the Reader will his; and therefore I ſhall truſt to the Merits of Mr <hi>Le Clerc,</hi> for an Excuſe; if they will not ſerve, I deſpair of any better, and ſhall ſhift without, as thoſe concern'd with me muſt do likewiſe. If we give the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any ſatisfaction, 'twill be double to us, and we ask no more.</p>

This was in my opinion not within the reach of Monſieur <hi>Menage,</hi> who was no Phyſician; tho his great learning ſufficiently warrants to me his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in the other method.

               <hi>Monſieur Lionardo de Capoa,</hi> a <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Phyſician of great reputation, is the only one, who in a Book publiſhed by him, wherein he treats of the Riſe and Progreſs of Phyſick, made it his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal aim to ſhew the uncertainty of it, overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Syſtems of almoſt all, particularly the Antient Phyſicians; for amongſt the Moderns he ſeems to ſide with thoſe, that eſpouſe the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Philoſophy, and <hi>Chymical</hi> Principles, explained after his own Senſe; at leaſt he allows theſe two to be the foundations of the true Phyſick, which ought to be eſtabliſht. But the Phyſicians that ground their practice upon them, being very few, eſpecially in <hi>Italy,</hi> he concludes Phyſick to be to this day very uncertain.</p>
            <p>We may allow Monſieur <hi>di Capoa</hi> to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the Hiſtory of Phyſick, ſo far as he has trac'd the Riſe and Progreſs of it. But beſides that he loſes the Character of a Hiſtorian, chooſing rather to combat as an Adverſary the opinions, he diſlikes, than to ſet 'em in their full light, and ſpinning his own reaſonings to much greater length than thoſe are of, which he oppoſes, he omits abundance of things of great importance to the Hiſtory, of which he treats. The chief uſe of his Book is to diſabuſe thoſe, that are prejudic'd in favour of the Antients. Nor are this learned Mans works of ſmall uſe, eſpecially in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where every thing that's new, is indifferent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>'Tis apparent from what has been ſaid, that no body has yet written this Hiſtory, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready remarkt, and that the Piece I now ſend abroad, is the firſt, that preciſely handles this matter. This makes me hope, that the World will give me ſome grains the more of allowance, and looking upon this only as an Eſſay, will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don more eaſily thoſe faults, they may find in it. Nor in reality do I offer it for any more than an Eſſay, my Subject yet, as I may ſay, but put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth its buds in this little Volume, which amounts not to a ſixth part of the whole, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This may ſuffice to ſtop the mouths of thoſe that may object, that I promiſe much, and perform little, that my Book does not make good its title, that the Mountain is in labour of a Mouſe. If I thought they were of that opinion, for whoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I ought to have a deference, I wou'd imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately reſign to ſome body elſe. But if they think more favourably of me, I ſhall perſiſt in hopes to improve, as I proceed, by the inſtructions I may receive. And I perſwade my ſelf, that Greater Wits, inſtead of accuſing me of preſumption in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting a work, that requires more learning than I am Maſter of, will be fo juſt, as to make ſome reckoning even of my weak endeavour; and treat me at leaſt, as <hi>Quintilian</hi> does a certain Author, whom he ranks among the indifferent ones.<note n="*" place="margin">Dignus vel hoc propoſito ut ilium ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d on as a compleat Model, every Author has made him the complement of his own diſcoveries; or if any one were ſo tenacious, as not to part with an invention which he thought he had a juſt title to; he has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately met with crowds of Opponents, that have uſed their utmoſt efforts, to ſhew, that <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> either ſaid, or ſaw it before; a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not abſolutely overcome to this hour. I have declin'd taking any party, or declaring for, or againſt the opinions I report; or if I have at any time taken more liberty it has been very rarely.</p>
            <p>As to the diſpoſition of my work, the firſt part, as I have ſaid, is the only one I publiſh at preſent, which contains chiefly the Phyſick of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> that being of greateſt importance in this Volume. The reſt, which reſpects the the State of Phyſick before him, and after him, not being ſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, tho all of uſe to the Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>The firſt part ſeems to contain nothing, but what is fabulous, or very uncertain. Yet even there, among the Fables of <hi>Eſculapius,</hi> and other deified Phyſicians, amidſt the weak Eſſays of the firſt Men to ſecure or diſengage themſelves from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, we diſcover the tracks of Med<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cines in in moſt places yet eſteem'd the principal; ſuch as Bleeding and Purging, the antiquity of which is thereby eſtabliſht.</p>
            <p>We may ſee likewiſe in the ſecond Book, that 'tis not abſolutely true, that from <hi>Eſculapius,</hi> or his Sons, to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> there was a ſort of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regnum
<pb facs="tcp:54988:12"/>in Phyſick, and that the ſix or ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years intervening between theſe two great Men were not time loſt, as ſome pretend. On the contrary, it ſhews that during this interval the Foundations of <hi>rational</hi> Phyſick were laid, the <hi>Diſſection</hi> of <hi>Animals</hi> introduced, and a new method of enquiry into the <hi>cauſes</hi> of <hi>diſtempers</hi> brought into play, for all which we are obliged to the <hi>Philoſophers, Pythagoras, Alemaeon, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus,</hi> and others therein mentioned.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to the Period that cloſes the 4th Book, which I call the firſt Hiſtory of Phyſick, we find nothing new, the term being very ſhort. We only obſerve that the Philoſophers of that time, the chief of which were <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> puſh'd on a little further in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their Predeceſſors their Anatomical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, eſpecially <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> The Practical Foundation laid by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, remained very little altered in all that Time.</p>
            <p>There remains only the Phyſick of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> which, as I have ſaid, is the moſt conſiderable part of this firſt Volume. What that is, may be ſeen in the third Book. I ſhall only add, that, if any man objects, that I have not exhauſted this rich Fund, but have left much unſaid, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it. But this I aſſure him, that, to the beſt of my Judgment, I have made <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſay nothing, but what he really did ſay, and that I have omitted nothing, that I thought very mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, either in his reaſonings, or his method.</p>
            <p>I have one word more more to add concerning the Language in which I write. If I had written in Latin, I might perhaps have had more Readers, and the faults have been leſs viſible; at leaſt I might have hoped for as eaſy pardon as abundance of other Authors, that have written lately in it, tho but indifferent Maſters of it. 'Tis pure hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that made me write in French. If my Book be worth the while, 'twill find Tranſlators enough to make it of uſe to Strangers. And for the French 'tis ſufficient, if they underſtand me, without being ſolicitous about the purity, or polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Stile, which ſeldom falls to the ſhare of thoſe that are but borderers upon the Country.</p>

Some, like the main Spring of a VVatch, give the motion, and ſet all the reſt a going: Others, leſs eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, may receive great damages, and ſtand ſtill, without ſtopping the motion of the whole. The Errors we commit in the uſe of thoſe things, that are neceſſary for the maintenance of this Engine, as Meat, Drink, Exerciſe, and Reſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which are thoſe, that uſually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the greateſt alterations in the principal Parts) nor even the violent impulſes of other Bodies, tend not always to its entire deſtruction; nay, often ſcarce cauſe a ſenſible diſorder. But, if it ſo falls out, ſuch is the wonderful contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of this Machine, that it can frequently ſhake off, unaſſiſted, the Clogs that impede its motion, and recover its former ſtate (or very near it); for, we muſt confeſs, that theſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſhocks wear, and deſtroy the Springs by inſenſible degrees.</p>
                     <p>But, when this diſorder riſes ſo high, that it cannot be ſurmounted by all the force of the Machine in its ordinary courſe, that there is a neceſſity of Foreign Aid; as there are about it ſome Bodies hurtful to, and entirely deſtructive of it, ſo there are others helpful, and beneficial in its extremeſt need. The Beaſts, under the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54988:13"/>direction of their Senſes only, know how to refrain, and guard themſelves from thoſe; and to take the benefit of theſe. I ſhall not here take into conſideration, what is commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of the Inſtinct of Brutes; of that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. 'Tis ſufficient to take notice, that Men, who have Reaſon, have not fail'd to make uſe of it on theſe occaſions.</p>
                     <p>The kindneſs they have for their own Bodies has taught 'em, ever ſince the beginning of the World, to diſtinguiſh carefully between what was uſeful for the preſervation of Life and Health, and what was deſtructive of 'em. They uſed their utmoſt endeavour to avoid the latter, but finding all their caution inſufficient, and that it was not always in their power to avoid the Cauſes of Diſeaſes, their refuge was to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve nicely the conduct of thoſe that were fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len ſick.</p>
                     <p>Finding therefore, that, in their opinion, ſuch or ſuch an Error had haſten'd the death of ſome, and ſuch and ſuch Conduct the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of others, and that then they made uſe of things, not uſed in time of health, to which they attributed their recovery, they, for the future, avoided what they thought hurtful to the former, and try<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If we muſt allow that Chance has made known to us ſeveral Poiſons, we muſt not deny, that the ſame Chance has made us acquainted with variety of ſalutary things; upon the proof of which, I ſhall not inſiſt any longer.</p>
                     <p>Not that <hi>Reaſoning</hi> has contributed leſs to the diſcovery of Remedies than Chance; we muſt reaſon even upon what Chance preſents us with, before we can make a right uſe of it. But this is not the only ſervice, that Reaſoning does us;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54988:15"/>if Chance alone has ſhewn us the vertue of ſome Medicaments, Reaſon alone guided the firſt Phyſicians to the knowledge of divers others, without the interpoſition of Chance: They need but compare the Diſtempers one with another, and examine the nature of the Medicines in uſe, to find that way abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of others before unknown.

                     <p>But how much ſoever of this nature we owe to Chance, or Reaſoning, it excludes not the concurrence of Providence.

                     <p>To be convinc'd of the Juſtice of <hi>Eſculapius</hi>'s proceedings, we need only to reflect upon the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent conduct of Labouring Men, and Gentlemen, in ſuch caſes.

He diſmiſſes his Phyſician, and returning to his uſual courſe of Life, falls to work, and recovers his health; or, if the Diſeaſe proves too mighty for him, he dies, and is rid at once of Life, and the troubles of the World.<note n="*" place="margin">I find our <hi>Maſons,</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters,</hi> and all other Artificers, of another mind, as fond of Life upon any terms, and as willing to be idle as e'er a Gentleman of 'em all, and I doubt they're ſo all the World over, whatever they might be in <hi>Plato</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</note> This no doubt is the true uſe, that all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks ought to make of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, to whom Work is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that when they can follow it no longer, Death is a favour. But it may be objected, that with the Rich, that live upon their Rents, the caſe alters, for they can't be reduc'd to that hard choice of Working or Dying.

                     <p>This conjecture ſeem'd to me well grounded.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54988:51"/>time is, ſays he, capable of variety of interpretation, either from the City where the Medal was coin'd, or from the Praetor or Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifex under whom it was coin'd. He further obſerves this word, where the <hi>Teleſphorus</hi> had nothing to no. If <hi>Monſieur Patin</hi> be not miſtaken, eſpecially in this laſt particular, my conjecture is entirely overthrown; for my part I readily ſubmit to his authority in a matter, whereof he is ſo great a Maſter.</p>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54988:51"/>thro' crouds of Spectators that were amaz'd at the Prodigy, went on board the</hi> Romans <hi>Veſſel to the Cabbin of</hi> Ogulnius. <hi>The Deputies, tranſported with joy of the Gods Company, arrived happily at</hi> Antium, <hi>where they abode ſome time, the rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Seas not permitting 'em to purſue their Voyage.

                     </p>
                     <p>Julian <hi>vomiting bloud, and his recovery being by every one deſpair'd of, the God by his Oracle gave him this anſwer; That he ſhould come, and take the Pine-apples upon his Altar, and eat of 'em three days with Honey, Which having perform'd,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54988:54"/>he was well, and came to return his thanks to the God in the preſence of all the people.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The God gave this Oracle to a blind Souldier, nam'd</hi> Valerius Aper; <hi>That he ſhou'd mingle the bloud of a white Cock with Honey, and make a</hi> Collyrium, <hi>which he ſhou'd put upon his eyes three days together. After which he ſaw, and came publickly to return his thanks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe remedies is purely <hi>ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,</hi> the reſt are natural, and not very unlike thoſe in ordinary uſe with the Phyſicians, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the ſeaſoning of ſuperſtition, which to this day makes Med'cines ſeem more effectual to the greateſt part of the World.</p>
                     <p>In probability the Prieſts of <hi>Eſculapius</hi> did not deal much in cures of the firſt ſort; except when they had a mind to impoſe upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by ſome Counterfeit, prepar'd to cheat 'em with a ſham diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>But when they had to do with men, that came to conſult their God upon caſes that were curable, it was for their credit to order means that acted naturally, which they might learn by the<note n="*" place="margin">If <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> became ſo famous by tranſcribing what was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd upon the Tables hung up in the Temple at <hi>Cos</hi> (as ſome will have it) what hinders but that the Prieſts themſelves, who had much greater advantages of that kind, ſhou'd be ſo too.

                     <p>It ſeems to have been very eaſie for theſe Prieſts, to make the ſick believe as they liſted. And whereas theſe wretches were uſually

                        <hi>Phyſick lay buried in a moſt profound darkneſs, till the</hi> Peloponneſian <hi>War broke out, when</hi> Hippocrates <hi>as it were reviv'd it, and brought it to light.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis at leaſt the ſpace of ſeven hundred years, from the firſt of theſe Wars down to the ſecond. <hi>Celſus</hi> does not deſcend altogether ſo low as <hi>Pliny;</hi> but we want only about fourſcore years, which diſtance of time there is between <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the firſt having liv'd in the lxth <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and the ſecond in the lxxxth.

                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">Celſ. Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat.</note>After thoſe whom I have mentioned (that is to ſay, the Sons of <hi>Aeſculapius</hi>) there was no perſon of reputation that practis'd Phyſick, till ſuch time as men began to apply themſelves more earneſtly to the ſtudy of learning, which being as prejudicial to the body, as it is ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the mind, it ſo fell out, that thoſe who purſu'd it with the greateſt application, having deſtroy'd their health with the perpetual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, and Watchings, had more occaſion for Phyſick than other Men. For this reaſon the ſcience of healing Maladies was at firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd as a branch of Philoſophy, ſo that we may juſtly affirm that Phyſick and Philoſophy were born together. This is the true cauſe why we find ſeveral of the ancient Philoſophers very well skill'd in Phyſick, among whom we may reckon <hi>Pythagoras, Empedocles,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus,</hi> as the moſt conſiderable.</p>
                     <p>What this Author ſays here, <hi>viz.</hi> that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and Philoſophy began together, is only purſuant to what he had advanc'd before, and we have already obſerv'd, <hi>that all the</hi> Phyſick of the Sons of <hi>Eſculapius</hi> and of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries, wholly conſiſted in healing of wounds.</p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:54988:65"/>
                     <p>If we muſt aſſign a reaſon for this great Vacuum which theſe Authors remark to have happen'd here in the Hiſtory of Phyſick, we may ſay that the knowledge of thoſe that practic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d it during this interval, being ſhut up within the narrow bounds of Empiriciſm, men were content with knowing a few Remedies, which experience had ſhown to be proper for certain Diſeaſes, without reaſoning either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the cauſe of the illneſs, or the operation of the remedies, ſo that theſe remedies being handed down from Father to Son, and never going out of the Family, there was no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to write upon this ſubject.</p>
                     <p>This being ſuppoſed, we are not to wonder that ſince theſe Phyſicians did not make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves known by their writings, which is one of the ſureſt ways of preſerving our memories, their names are buried in oblivion. Another reaſon, no leſs forcible than the former, is this, that thoſe who ſucceeded <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> and his Son, how great ſoever their skill and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence might be, lived in a fabulous age, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no opportunity to aſſiſt at ſo celebrated a Siege as that of <hi>Troy,</hi> they wanted a <hi>Homer</hi> to immortalize their names.</p>

                        <l>Vixere fortes ante Agamemnona</l>

                     <p>One might however have expected that the Hiſtorians wou'd have done what we cou'd not hope from the Poets, but the Hiſtory of theſe times is generally ſo confus'd and defective, that the Phyſicians are not the only perſons that have reaſon to complain of it. We don't certainly know when <hi>Homer</hi> liv'd, but much leſs the place where he was born.</p>
                     <p>Therefore tho we ſhou'd allow with <hi>Celſus,</hi> that during this ſpace of time, there was no Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians of any note, whoſe memory is preſerv'd down to us, we ought not to impute it to them,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54988:66"/>but to the Age wherein they lived, and it does not follow that Med<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Iſidore</hi> of <hi>Sevil</hi> more clearly diſcuſſes this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. <hi>Apollo</hi> paſſes among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſays he, for the author and inventor of Phyſick. His Son <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> improv'd this Art, or at leaſt had the reputation of doing it, but being kill'd by a Thunderbolt, 'tis ſaid that ever ſince that Phyſick was forbidden, and that the art periſh'd at the ſame moment with its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; having been conceal'd or bury'd for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt 500 years, till the Reign of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> when <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the Son of <hi>Aſclepius</hi> of the Iſle of <hi>Co,</hi> diſcover'd it again to the world.</p>
                     <p>If we were to believe the account this Author gives us, the reaſon of the interruption of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick is evident enough. After <hi>Eſculapius</hi>'s death, no mention was made of this Art till the time of <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> but in all appearance he was but ill inform'd of what happen'd du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that period he ſets down, as he was of the true name of the Father of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> whom he calls <hi>Aſclepius</hi> by a groſs miſtake, imagining, I ſuppoſe, that he was call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>AS for what relates to the Phyſitians of <hi>Cos,</hi> we may likewiſe aſſert, that if the <hi>Coan pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notions,</hi> that are to be found among the works of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> are nothing but a collection of the Practitioners of <hi>Cos,</hi> as ſeveral perſons have believ'd, that they were none of the niceſt reaſoners, nay, we may ſay, that they did not take the leaſt care to give an account of their <hi>Prognoſtics.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From what has been ſaid it will appear, that it is not altogether true that <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Celſus</hi> have advanc'd, <hi>viz.</hi> that we meet with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the hiſtory of Phyſick in ſo long an interval, but much leſs that Phyſick and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy began together, as the latter aſſerts, unleſs he is to be underſtood about <hi>Rational Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi> that is to ſay, about that which is peculiarly employ'd in <hi>finding out the hidden cauſes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d not begin but with the ſtudy of Learning and the Sciences. It will be objected to me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion, that I have here forgotten to ſpeak of a thing, for which the <hi>Aſclepiadae</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd moſt reputation, and which overthrows all that I have ſaid about their manner of practice, which I maintain'd to be almoſt wholly empirical, <hi>viz.</hi> of their paſſing in the World for great Anatomiſts. 'Tis certain that <hi>Galen</hi> is of this opinion. <hi>At that time,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that Phyſick,</hi> was wholly confin'd within the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the <hi>Aſclepiadae,</hi> the Fathers taught their Children Anatomy, and accuſtom'd them from their infancy to diſſect Animals, ſo that this being handed down from Father to Son, it was needleſs to ſet down in writing, how every thing was done, ſince it was full as impoſſible for them to forget this, as the Alphabet which they learnt at the ſame time.</p>
                     <p>Several other paſſages we meet in this Author, by which we may ſee, that he really believ'd that the <hi>Aſclepiadae</hi> were perfectly well skill'd in Anatomy. But we may confront the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this Phyſician with that of the ancient Commentator upon <hi>Plato,</hi> who expreſsly ſays that the Philoſopher <hi>Alcmaeon,</hi> of whom we ſhall have occaſion to talk in the following Chapter was the firſt that diſſected any Animal; which deſtroys all that <hi>Galen</hi> has advanc'd about the <hi>Aſclepiadae,</hi> at leaſt thoſe of them that preceeded <hi>Alcmaeon,</hi> with whom alone we are concern'd, here for as for thoſe that follow'd him, they were either contemporaries with <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> or elſe came after him.</p>
                     <p>Tho we were deſtitute of the teſtimony of this Author, yet by the little progreſs, that was made in Anatony even in the time of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himſelf, it ſeems at leaſt probable, that men had examin'd the bodies of Animals but very ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially, which is remote enough from what
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54988:69"/>
                        <hi>Galen</hi> aſſerts, that Anatomy was in its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the time of the <hi>Aſclepiadae.</hi> And as for what he adds about a certain interval, which he pretends to have been between the moſt antient <hi>Aſclepiadae</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> during which he wou'd needs perſwade us that Anatomy was neglected, the Reader will find in the Chapter of <hi>Eraſiſtratus,</hi> what judgment he is to paſs upon that matter.</p>
                     <p>I wou'd not be ſuppos'd to affirm, that the <hi>Aſclepiadae</hi> had no manner of knowledge of the parts of bodies. It wou'd be a great abſurdity to maintain it, for without this knowledge they cou'd neither practice Phyſick in general, nor Chirurgery in particular. Without doubt they knew very well, as for inſtance, the Bones, their Scituation, Figure, Articulation, and all that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon them; for otherwiſe they cou'd not have ſet them when they were broken or diſlocated. Neither cou'd they be ignorant of the Scituation of the moſt conſiderable Veſſels. It is likewiſe neceſſary, that they ſhou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand where the Veins and Arteries lye, becauſe they open'd and burnt them continually; for we have already obſerv'd in the Chapter of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalirius,</hi> that theſe operations were very common even in the firſt age of Phyſick. Beſides, it was highly requiſite, that they ſhou'd very well know the places where the profoundeſt Veſſels meet, to avoid the loſs of blood, when they made any inciſions, or when they cut off any of the members. In ſhort, they were oblig'd to know ſeveral places, where there were <hi>Tendons</hi> and <hi>Ligaments,</hi> and ſome conſiderable <hi>Nerves;</hi> altho they confounded theſe three different parts, and knew very little of the laſt, as we ſhall ſhow hereafter. Beſides this, they knew ſomething in general of the chief Inteſtins, as the <hi>Stomach,</hi> the <hi>Guts,</hi> the <hi>Liver,</hi> the <hi>Spleen,</hi> the <hi>Kidneys,</hi> the <hi>Bladder,</hi> the <hi>Matrix,</hi> the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm,</hi> the <hi>Heart,</hi> the <hi>Lungs,</hi> the <hi>Brain;</hi> as well as the moſt ſenſible humours, ſuch as the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54988:70"/>
                        <hi>Blood, Cholar, Melancholy, Flegm,</hi> the <hi>Seroſities,</hi> or <hi>Waters,</hi> and all the different ſort of excrements that proceed from ſeveral parts of our body.</p>
                     <p>It appears at firſt Sight, that the <hi>Aſclepiadae,</hi> cou'd not know all this without being <hi>Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi> or at leaſt without having <hi>diſſected</hi> Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; but 'tis eaſy to demonſtrate, that they might attain to the knowledge of theſe things without it. The firſt and moſt familiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction they had came from their <hi>Butchers,</hi> and their <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and as for what relates to to a <hi>human body</hi> in particular, they were glad of any opportunity to inſtruct themſelves, when they found any bones in the Fields, that were ſtript of the Fleſh either by Beaſts, or the length of time, that theſe bodies had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the air, or when they found in ſome by places the carcaſs of ſome unfortunate Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, that had been murder'd by Robbers, or the bodies of Soldiers, that died of the great wounds of they receiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d in Battel. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd them without giving themſelves the trouble to make any other Preparation, beſides what they found ready made to their hands, and took no notice of that ſcruple, which forbad them to touch any dead body which they found by accident. This was ſo great a ſcruple among the Ancients, that it appears from a paſſage in <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> which we ſhall cite hereafter, that in his time there was no diſſection of human bodies. Now this Philoſopher liv'd above fourſcore years after <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> Tis true indeed, that the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as we have already taken notice, having been accuſtomed of old to embalm dead bodies, were furniſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d by this means with an opportunity to know the true diſpoſition of ſome parts of the body, which they muſt needs lay open, when they ſeparated them from others to preſerve the reſt; and it might ſo happen, that the <hi>Aſclepiadae</hi> reapt ſome advantage by theſe diſcoveries of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> but as the chief intention of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was the preſerving of Bodies, ſo they
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54988:70"/>ſcarce proceeded much farther, than it was neceſſary for them to go on with their deſign.</p>
                     <p>I have thus recounted the ſeveral means by which theſe ancient Phyſicians diſcover'd the ſtructure of bodies after the Death of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal; but the beſt School they had, and indeed that which inſtructed them better than any of the reſt, was the <hi>Practice of their Profeſſio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>HItherto, as we have obſerv'd, it does not appear that Reaſon had been very much conſulted in Phyſick, the whole knowledge of which Art ſeems to have totally conſiſted in diſcerning and knowing Diſeaſes rather by their <hi>ſigns</hi> than by their <hi>cauſes,</hi> and uſing a few ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Medicaments, that were almoſt all taken from Herbs, or the practice of ſome <hi>magical</hi> or <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> Remedies.

Empedocles,</hi> of whom we ſhall talk hereafter, is the only man among them who is reported to have perform'd a cure.

                        <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who liv'd about the lx <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and founded the <hi>Italick</hi> School, is the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient we know of thoſe that began to take this Art into their conſideration. This Pihloſopher neglected no means nor opportunity to render
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54988:71"/>his knowledge univerſal. With this deſign he travell'd into <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was the Country of Arts and Sciences, and learnt all their curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities. 'Tis very probable he borrow'd all the knowledge he had in Phyſick from thence, of which we have nothing remaining but a few ſmall fragments, which however ſufficiently diſcover a Spirit of ſuperſtition ſo remarkable in the preceeding Phyſicians, as we have already obſerv'd, that which relates to Phyſiology being very inconſiderable.<note n="(a)" place="margin">Diogen.

At the end of this Chapter we ſhall examine what he meant by this. He likewiſe aſſerted, that the Veins, the Arteries, the Nerves, are the cords of the Soul.

                     <p>There are ſtill remaining ſome precepts which he gave, relating to a man's managing of himſelf to preſerve his health.

                     <p>THe <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Philoſophers were not the only perſons that concern'd themſelves with Phyſick. <hi>Heraclitus</hi> the <hi>Epheſian</hi> (who liv'd in the 69th <hi>Olympiad,</hi> that is to ſay, about the ſame time with <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and had a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy peculiar to himſelf) applied himſelf likewiſe to the ſtudy of Phyſick.</p>
                     <p>Hiſtory informs us, that this Philoſopher, puſhed on by his moroſe auſtere humour, which occaſion'd the report that he always wept, retiring into a ſolitary place to avoid the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of mankind, and living only upon water and herbs, fell into a <hi>Dropſy.</hi> This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd him, to repair to inhabited places to find better conveniences of being cur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>He once demanded of them in obſcure terms, as his manner,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Diogenes Laeat.</note> 
                        <hi>if of rainy weather they cou'd make dry,</hi> which not being underſtood by the Phyſicians, he diſmiſs'd them, and ſhut himſelf up in a Stable, where he cover'd all his body with dung, hoping by that means, to conſume or drain the ſuperfluous moiſture that was in his entrails, but he did not ſucceed in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, for he died of this diſeaſe ſoon after. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclitus</hi>

                     <p>Others relate, that <hi>Heraclitus</hi> put this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to the Phyſicians, <hi>whether it were poſſible to preſs the bowels of any one ſo as to get out all the water that was contain'd in them,</hi> which the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians affirming to be impoſſible, he expos'd, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf naked to the Sun, and afterwards manag'd himſelf in the Stable, as is related above; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of which was, that he was devour'd by Dogs as he lay in the dung, being ſo weak, that he was not able to help himſelf. In ſhort, others have deliver'd this ſtory otherwiſe, and affirm that <hi>Heraclitus</hi> was cur'd of this ſwelling, and dy'd long after this of another diſtemper.

                     <p>This raillery perhaps was occaſion'd by the jealouſy of this Philoſopher, who was concern'd to ſee <hi>Acron</hi> conſider'd as the chief man of that Art to which he pretended himſelf, upon which I have a reflection to make of ſome importance to the hiſtory of Phyſick, which is, that the ambition of <hi>Acron,</hi> or the good opinion he had of himſelf, intirely deſtroys the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Hypotheſis of <hi>Celſus,</hi> concerning the birth or beginning of Phyſick; for if this art owed its original to Philoſophy, and there was no knowledge of it before the Philoſophers, it is not probable that <hi>Acron,</hi> who came after them, or at leaſt after <hi>Phythagoras,</hi> ſhould be ſo bold, as to pretend to the firſt place among the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians to their prejudice. 'Tis certain that there were Phyſicians before Philoſophers, but their Phyſick, as we have obſerv'd, was wholy <hi>empiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> like that of <hi>Acron.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis not improbable, that the reaſon why this Phyſician paſſed for the chief of the <hi>empi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric</hi> ſect, was becauſe he attempted to maintain that ancient way of practiſing Phyſick, againſt that which the Philoſophers his contemporaries affected to introduce.</p>
                     <p>The above-cited Paſſage of <hi>Pliny</hi> ſeems to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour this conjecture, but 'tis probable that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was miſtaken.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Galen</hi> ſeems to make <hi>Eſculapius</hi> the author of <hi>Gymnaſtic,</hi> as well as the other branches of Phyſick, where he ſays <hi>that</hi> Eſculapius <hi>order'd ſome to ride on Horſeback, and to exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their arms, and that he ſhow'd them the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of motions they were to expreſs, and after what manner they were to be arm'd.

                     </p>
                     <p>Long before the time of <hi>Herodicus</hi> ſeveral ſorts of exerciſes were uſed in their publick ſports, that were celebrated in many places of <hi>Greece</hi> with ſolemnity. The inſtitutors of theſe Games propos'd hereby to divert the people, and to make mens bodies more active, vigorous, and fit for war, as alſo to obtain the favour of their God, in the honour of whom they were kept. The end of thoſe that were perſonally engag'd in theſe ſports, was to carry off the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that were allotted to the Conquerors. The ſame thing was practiſed in their <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> which they called <hi>Gymnaſia</hi> and <hi>Palaeſtrae, i. e. places proper for one to exerciſe himſelf in.</hi> We cannot preciſely tell the time when theſe ſorts of Academies were firſt begun to be erected; what we know for certain is, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> were always looked upon to be the firſt inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54988:83"/>of them. The Reader may conſult <hi>Hieron Mercurialis,</hi> for his farther ſatisfaction upon this ſubject. <hi>Herodicus</hi> who was Maſter of one of theſe Academies, having obſerv'd, that the young People that were under his conduct, and learnt their exerciſes, were very healthful for the moſt part, imputed this immediately to the continual uſe of them, and afterwards carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this firſt reflection farther, which was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral enough, he came to be of the opinion, that mighty advantages might be drawn from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, if inſtead of the above mention'd ends, the principal aim a man propoſed to himſelf by it, <hi>was</hi> the <hi>acquiring</hi> or <hi>preſerving</hi> of his health; ſo that he need have recourſe to no other Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick than this.</p>

                     <p>I don't know whether he ſucceeded ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily in this project, as the experiment made upon himſelf, of which Hiſtory makes mention, wou'd induce us to believe. <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who had been his Diſciple, does not give him an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous character upon this account, where he ſays, <hi>that Herodicus</hi> kill'd ſeveral that were ill of Fevers, with too much walking, and wreſtling, and fomentations; nothing being
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54988:84"/>ſo prejudicial to perſons in ſuch caſes, as hunger, wreſtling, running, rubbing, <hi>&amp;c. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodicus,</hi> (adds <hi>Hippocrates</hi>) <hi>pretending to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the fatigue occaſion'd by ſickneſs with another fatigue, drew upon his Patients ſometimes infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, ſometimes pains on their ſide,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and made them pale, livid, and wholly out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>However this cenſure of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> did not hinder him from making uſe of ſome <hi>Gymna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick</hi> on ſome occaſions, altho he did not look upon it to be good in the caſes above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, and moſt of the Phyſicians that came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Herodicus</hi> took ſo great a fancy to this ſort of Phyſick, that they have always conſider'd it as an eſſential part of their profeſſion. We have loſt the writings which <hi>Diocles, Praxago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, Philotimus, Eraſiſtratus, Herophilus, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clepiades, Theon, Diotimus,</hi> and ſeveral others compos'd upon that ſubject; but by the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are ſtill remaining in <hi>Galen,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Authors that have cited them, we may eaſily know in what eſteem <hi>Gymnaſtick</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Antients.</p>
                     <p>The Phyſicians were not the only perſons that recommended it. The generality of men were ſo fully convinc'd of the great advantages, and alſo the pleaſure that accompany'd it, that abundance of people ſpent the greateſt part of their lives in places appointed on purpoſe to exerciſe in, that were afterwards erected in all the Cities of <hi>Greece.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis true, theſe Buildings that went under the name of <hi>Gymnaſia, ,</hi> were not ſolely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to <hi>Gymnaſtick</hi> Phyſick, for at the ſame time they were put to ſeveral other uſes.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54988:84"/>Thus the <hi>Academy</hi> and <hi>Lyceum,</hi> two places of exerciſe in <hi>Athens</hi> became famous, one of them being choſen by <hi>Plato,</hi> and the other by <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> to teach Philoſophy in. This ſeparate place for the Philoſophers was call'd <hi>Exedra,</hi> which in <hi>Greek</hi> ſignifies a Seat, becauſe there are benches in it for this purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>There were other Apartments ſet aſide for the young men, that came to exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under Maſters call'd <hi>Gymnaſtae,</hi> who had ſome Servants under them that were call'd <hi>Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotribae.</hi> The <hi>Wreſtlers</hi> likewiſe met there.

                     </p>
                     <p>Part of theſe exerciſes were alſo practic'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently by all ſorts of perſons for their <hi>health,</hi> but the Apartments that were more peculiarly applied to this laſt uſe, were the bathing rooms, thoſe where they were <hi>undreſs'd,</hi> or where they order'd themſelves to be <hi>rubb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some went no farther than one, while others applied themſelves ſucceſſively to more. Men of learning began with hearing the Philoſophers, and other <hi>Virtuoſi;</hi> after this they play'd at Ball, or employ'd themſelves in any other exerciſe, and at laſt went to the Bath.</p>
                     <p>One may wonder, and reaſonably enough, how <hi>Plato</hi> comes to inveigh ſo furiouſly againſt <hi>Gymnaſtic,</hi> and the inventor of it.

                     <p>THis is the ſumm of what we cou'd meet with moſt conſiderable, in that interval which may be call'd <hi>the firſt age of Phyſick.</hi> We have in a manner fetch'd all our materials from <hi>Greece,</hi> for want of monuments to inſtruct us what paſt in other Nations; and for the future we ſhall more ſeldom leave that Country, ſince the <hi>Greeks</hi> cultivated Phyſick as well as they did the other arts, with more care and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the ſucceeding times, and indeed communicated them to almoſt all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>
                     <p>One would be apt to imagine, at firſt ſight, that all we can find of the progreſs of Phyſick in the firſt and ſecond period of time, which we have ran over, is very inconſiderable.

                     <p>Nevertheleſs, if Phyſick rather conſiſts in effects than in diſcourſes, and if the invention of remedies is of greater importance than all the reaſonings that can be made upon diſeaſes, as we ſhall ſee hereafter, we ſhall be ſatisfy'd that theſe firſt Phyſicians knew almoſt every thing that was eſſential to Phyſick, or at leaſt paſſes for ſuch now in moſt parts of <hi>Europe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> was the firſt that undertook to make this ſeparation. He had not ſtrictly addicted himſelf to that ſort of Phyſick, that was hereditary in his Family, but made as great advances into Philoſophy, as any man of his age, but believing that the ſpeculations of this latter Science were not ſo uſeful to Society, as the practice of the former, he retain'd ſo much Philoſophy as wou'd enable him to reaſon juſtly in Phyſick, which he made his principal, or rather his only ſtudy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Soranus</hi> pretends that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> was born in the Iſle of <hi>Co,</hi> in the firſt year of the 80th <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad,</hi> but others make him older, as we ſee below. His Fathers name was <hi>Heraclides,</hi> his Mothers <hi>Phaenarete</hi> or <hi>Praxithea.</hi> We have already ſeen, when we had occaſion to ſpeak of the <hi>Aſclepiadae,</hi> that on his Fathers ſide he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be the 17th in order of deſcent from <hi>Eſculapius;</hi> nor was he leſs noble by the mothers ſide, as being the 19th deſcendant from <hi>Hercules.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was not content with learning Phyſick under his Father; he had <hi>Herodicus</hi> above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd for his Maſter in that faculty. He was likewiſe the diſciple of <hi>Gorgias</hi> the <hi>Sophiſt,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to that Phyſician, and according to ſome, of <hi>Democritus</hi> the Philoſopher, as we gather from the above-cited paſſage of <hi>Celſus.</hi> But if he learnt any thing of this latter twas in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, by the converſations chiefly which he had with him, when he was intreated by the <hi>Abderites</hi> to come and cure this Philoſopher. It is likewiſe credible, that he was a follower of <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> as we ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Hippocrates</hi> was not looked upon to be the firſt inventor, yet all antiquity gives him this
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54988:88"/>honour at leaſt, of being the firſt that re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed it after <hi>Eſculapius</hi> and his Sons. It may alſo be affirm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers mention'd by us in the preceeding Book, were well enough vers'd in the art of reaſoning, but wanted experience or practice. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is the firſt perſon who poſſeſs'd both one and the other.</p>
                     <p>This may ſeem to contradict what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready advanc'd upon the credit of <hi>Celſus, viz.</hi> that <hi>Hippocrates ſeparated Phyſick from Philoſophy.</hi> For a Salvo to this ſeeming contradiction, we need only ſuppoſe, that <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who was deſcended of a Family, where he as it were
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54988:89"/>ſuck'd in Phyſick with his Milk, finding this Art in the hands of Philoſophers, who had lately engroſs'd it to the prejudice of the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clepiadae,</hi> thought there was no better way to ſupport the declining honour of his houſe, than by uſing his utmoſt efforts, beſides the knowledge deriv'd to him by tradition, to acquire all that learning which gave theſe new Phyſicians ſo great a reputation in the world. But after he had made himſelf Maſter of it, he openly declar'd, that altho the lights of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy were very ſerviceable to give a man a juſt Idea of things, and to conduct methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally and in the right way ſuch as deſign'd to carry arts to perfection; yet however that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy was not ſufficient of itſelf to perfect a man for all profeſſions, if he did not deſcend to the particulars, which did not belong to its juriſdiction; that Philoſophy had <hi>nature</hi> in <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> for its object, but that Phyſick in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner applies itſelf to nature as it had a relation to man, whom ſhe conſider'd under the different circumſtances of <hi>health</hi> and <hi>ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> that it did not follow that a man muſt be a Phyſician becauſe he was a Philoſopher, unleſs he had ſtudy'd humane body in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and inſtructed himſelf in the ſeveral changes that befall it, and in the proper me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to preſerve or reſtore; that ſince 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to acquire this knowledge without long experience, he ought to employ his whole time this way, and quit the general name of a Philoſopher for that of a Phyſician, tho this oblig'd him by no means to forbear Philoſophizing in his profeſſion. And this is what <hi>Hippocrates</hi> meant by <hi>joyning Philoſophy with Phyſick, and Phyſick with Philoſophy.</hi>

                     <p>But while we are upon the Philoſophy of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> leſt the Alchymiſts ſhou'd take it ill at our hands, we muſt by no means omit this paſſage in the firſt Book above-mention'd, viz. <hi>that thoſe that work in Gold, beat it, waſh it, and melt it by a gentle Fire, becauſe a violent fire is not proper for ſuch a buſineſs.</hi> 'Tis pretended

                     <p>And this may ſuffice for his Philoſophy.

                     <p>'TIs a difficult matter to give a juſt extract of the Anatomy of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> for three things hinder us from knowing ſo much of this ſubject as it is neceſſary we ſhou'd. In the firſt place we find ſeveral contradictions in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> or rather in thoſe that are aſcrib'd to him. Secondly, tho we ſhou'd heap together all that he ſays of each part, 'twould be an imperfect account, and not very coherent, Laſtly, tho ſo many faults had not crept into the Text as there have, or there were leſs diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the original MSS. yet his ſtile is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and there are ſome places in him ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, as being frequently expreſſed in terms pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54988:92"/>to himſelf, that are not to be found elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, that 'tis extreamly difficult for one to underſtand him aright, tho he is never ſo great a maſter of the <hi>Greek</hi> Language.</p>
                     <p>For this reaſon we ſhould very much regret the loſs of one of <hi>Galen</hi>'s Books, intituled, <hi>The Anatomy of</hi> Hippocrates, if we had not juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect this Author of partiality, when he engages for the intereſts of this antient Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, ſufficient proofs whereof we ſhall ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that purely belong to Anatomy.</p>
                     <p>The helps that a man might expect to find upon this occaſion from the modern Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, is but inconſiderable. If any light is to be had from them, we ought rather to truſt the antient interpreters than thoſe of our Age: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is to be feared, that the latter, full of their new diſcoveries, imagine they ſee them every where, like thoſe that can diſcover in <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> the moſt hidden myſteries of all Arts and Sciences; or thoſe quick-ſighted Genelemen, that can find the Philoſophers Stone, in all Books whatever, let the matter they treat of be what it will.</p>
                     <p>That we may not be charg'd with being guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this prepoſſeſſion, which we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd our ſelves, we will faithfully ſet down all that we cou'd find relating to this argument in the works of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and take particular care not to omit the leaſt thing about which the Anatomiſts of the following ages have had dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent opinions, or pretended to make any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, that ſo we may give every man his due, and rob none of the praiſe that really belongs to them.</p>
                     <p>I will not pretend to confine my ſelf to a certain order, but indifferently ſet down every thing as it comes to hand, and refer the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that expects a continu'd deſcription, or a greater inſight into the nature, connexion, ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the parts of the body, to a full trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Anatomy, which he will find in the Chapter of <hi>Galen.</hi>

                     <p>The Artery, <hi>adds he,</hi> immediately after, contains more heat than the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> and is the receptacle of the Spirits. There are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Veins in the Body beſides theſe two. As for that which is reported to be the largeſt of all, and next to the heart, it runs thro the Belly and the Diaphragm, and dividing itſelf into two ſtreams, viſits either Kidney towards the Loins. Above the heart this Vein divides to the right and to the left, and aſcending to the head, diſtributes itſelf to either Temple. We may, <hi>continues he,</hi> joyn the other Veins to this that are alſo very large, but to ſpeak all in a word, all the Veins that are diſpers'd thro
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54988:94"/>the whole Body, come from the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> and the <hi>Artery.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here are already two opinions concerning the Origin of the Veins and Arteries: There is a third likewiſe to be found in two ſeveral paſſages in <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> whether in reſpect of the Origin of the Veins, or in reſpect of your diſtribution.<note n="(a)" place="margin">Lib. de Oſſium naturâ &amp; de Natur. humanâ.</note> 
                        <hi>The largeſt veins of the Body, are,</hi> ſays he, <hi>diſpos'd after this manner. There are in all four pair; the firſt pair come out behind the head, and deſcending down the back part of the neek, on each ſide of the ſpine, come to the Hips and Thighs, paſs on thro the Legs to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of each Foot. For this reaſon, in all pains of the Back and Hips, bleeding in the veins of the Hams and external Ancles, are of great relief; the ſecond pair coming likewiſe from the Head, run behind the Ears down the Neck; they are call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For this cauſe, in all pains of the Teſticles and Loins, bleeding in the veins of the Hams and internal Ancles is very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable. The third pair come out of the Temples, and run along the Neck towards the Shoulders and Lungs, from thence one turning from the right a little towards the left, runs under the Breaſt, to the Spleen and Kidneys, the other likewiſe turning from the left to the right, runs under the Breaſt to the Liver and Kidney. And theſe two branches terminate in the Rectum. The fourth part coming out of the fore part of the Head and Eyes, run under the Lungs and the Clavicles, and from thence thro the upper part of the Arm, paſs over the bending of the Elbow, to the back of the Hands and Fingers, and thence they return again thro the palm of the Hand, on the inſide of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, and under the Arm to the Arm-pits, and upon the ſurface of the ſide, one to the Spleen and the other to the Liver. At length both branches
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54988:94"/>running over the Belly, terminate in the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>

                     <p>To ſalve the contradiction between theſe two laſt paſſages, it may be urg'd that the Book <hi>of the nature of the Bones,</hi> from whence this latter is drawn, is not <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s, but <hi>Polybius,</hi> his Son-in-Law's. Neither <hi>Galen</hi> nor <hi>Erotian</hi> take notice of this Book among the works of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates.</hi> They have not ſo much as taken notice of the name, tho they ſeem to have explain'd certain words found in it.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>There is another difficulty relating to the Book <hi>of the fleſh or of the principles,</hi> from whence was taken what we ſaid in the firſt place, <hi>that the Veins and Arteries came out of the Heart.

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54988:95"/>with</hi> Polybius <hi>to bring the veins from the Head, concludes they were all in an error, not knowing that they came from the Heart, and not from the Head.</hi> If <hi>Hippocrates</hi> be the Author of that Book <hi>of the Fleſh,</hi> wherein this opinion of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> is plainly laid down, how is it likely this Philoſopher ſhould not know it?

Theſe Membranes are diſpoſed with more Art, or more Exactneſs, on the Left-ſide than the Right. The reaſon of this is, becauſe the <hi>Soul of Man,</hi> or the <hi>Reaſonable Soul, which is above the other Soul,</hi> has its Seat in the Left ventricle of the Heart. This Soul has not its nouriſhment from the Meat which comes from the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but from a pure luminous Matter ſeparated from the Blood. This Matter which ſerves for Aliment to the Soul, is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly furniſhed from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Receptacle of the Blood, and caſts its Rays round, as the Natural nouriſhment, which comes from the Inteſtines and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54988:97"/>Belly, is diſtributed into all parts; and for fear, leſt that which is contained in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, ſhou'd hinder the courſe of the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Soul, and give a check to its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Orifice of this Artery is cloſed as aforeſaid, for the great Artery is nouriſhed from the belly and inteſtines, and not by this firſt or principal nouriſhment. But the great Artery is not nouriſhed by the blood, which we ſee, as is manifeſt by opening the left ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of any Animal, for we find it quite emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or find nothing in it but ſerous humour, or a little Bile, and the aforeſaid Membranes, but the Artery is never without blood, nor the right ventricle. This Veſſel therefore gave occaſion to the making of thoſe Membranes for the paſſage out of the right ventricle, is likewiſe furniſhed with Membranes, but the blood moves upon that ſide but feebly. This way is open on the ſide, to carry the blood thither for its nouriſhment, but it is ſhut to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the heart; ſo that way is left for the air to paſs inſenſibly from the lungs to the heart, not in great quantities, for the heat which in this part is but feeble, wou'd be over-power'd by the cold, the blood not being naturally warm, no more than water which receives its heat from elſewhere, tho moſt believe it's hot in its own nature.</p>

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:54988:108"/>Maſters profit, to leap ſeveral times upon the ground; which ſhe having done, the Seed came away with noiſe. It was like, <hi>ſays he,</hi> to a raw Egg without a ſhell, the liquor of which was very tranſparent. He ſaw there very fine white Fibres upon the Membrane, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this liquor, which being mix'd with a thick blackiſh red Matter, which made the whole Membrane appear red, there was in the middle of this Membrane ſomething very fine, which he took for the Navel, and it was about the beginning of the place of the Origin of the Membrane.</q>

                        <p>The Author continuing to examine what happens to the Embryo in the Womb, from the time that its body is form'd, to the time of its birth, ſays, <hi>That the body of a Female has all its Parts diſtinct, at the end of forty days at far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt, and the Male at thirty.</hi> For which he gives this reaſon, <hi>That the Seed which produces a Female is more feeble and moiſt than that which produces a Male.</hi> He gives alſo another reaſon drawn from the time of Womens evacuations after Labour, which for brevity ſake we ſhall omit here. He adds, for the difference of Sexes, That Males are begotten when the Seed of both Male and Female is vigorous; and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, when their Seed is weaker or moiſter, and has leſs heat. He obſerves, That the Males come from the right ſide of the Womb, which is ſtronger and hotter, and the Females from the left.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>The Body of the Infant being thus rough drawn, grows continually, drawing to it ſelf the moſt Oily part of the blood of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which makes its bones become more hard, the fingers part, and nails come upon their ends, hair upon their heads, and other parts of their bodies. After three months the Male begins to ſtir, and the Female gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally after four; tho' there may be ſometimes ſome variation. The Infant being come to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54988:109"/>its juſt growth and bulk, and not finding any longer ſufficient nouriſhment from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, begins to ſtir violently, and breaks the Membranes in which it was wrapp'd, and ſo procures its excluſion, which happens uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the tenth month. Being born, it's nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with the Milk of its Mother, or a Nurſe. The matter of which this Milk is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, is the moſt fat and oily part of the Aliment, after this manner. The Womb, as it grows big, preſſes the <hi>Omentum</hi> and Belly, and by that compreſſion obliges 'em to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their fat, which is preſently ſuckt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Breaſts; the veins of which dilate themſelves afterwards more and more, by the ſucking of the Infants.</q>

                        <p>This, according to our Author, is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the formation, and increaſe of Infants in the Womb, and of their coming into the World; which is to be underſtood of ordinary caſes, which exclude not the extraordinary ones, whereof in ſome Books written for that purpoſe, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> gives a particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>

                        <p>There are two Books, one Intituled, <hi>The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Months Birth;</hi> and the other, <hi>The eighth Months Birth.</hi> The firſt of theſe Children may live, and arrive at a good Age, but not the ſecond; which, according to our Author, muſt neceſſarily die in its entrance into the World, or preſently after. The reaſon that he gives of this difference is, That ſeven months after conception the Child in the Womb being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly form'd, and already pretty ſtrong, altho' it has ſome time to grow, moves very vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, which cauſes the Membranes, in which it is involv'd, to ſtretch a little, as we ſee the Ears of Corn open ſome time before the Grain is ripe. It happens ſometimes that this diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54988:110"/>being greater than the Membranes can bear, they break and the birth muſt follow. This Birth being too early, moſt of them that are born at that time die immediately. But as we have obſerved, the Infant having at that time his body compleatly form'd, ſome however eſcape with due care.</p>
                        <p>As for thoſe that remain longer in the Womb, after the relaxation of the Membranes, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſuppoſes that the ſtrong efforts they have made, renders them weak and ſick for forty days; ſo that if they are born in that time, the freſh efforts which they are oblig'd to make to force their way into the World, quite ruins their ſtrength, and certainly kills them, whereas thoſe that out-ſtay the term, eſpecially thoſe that have forty days more to recover in, being born in full ſtrength, eaſily ſurvive.</p>
                        <p>Theſe two forty days are the laſt of ſeven, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſuppoſes to paſs between the time of the conception and the birth of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who come according to the ordinary courſe of Nature.</p>
                        <p>He ſuppoſes at leaſt, that if the Child does not ſtay the full ſeven times forty days, which carries the time of birth ten days over nine months, reckoning as he does thirty days to a month, it ought at leaſt to be enter'd into the laſt forty days; as thoſe are that are born be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the beginning and end of the ninth month.</p>
                        <p>He thought likewiſe that it was ſufficient for Children, that came in the ſeventh month, that they were enter'd into the ſeventh.

                        <p>From this Hypotheſis, it is plain that Health and Sickneſs in general depend upon the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Cauſes: On the <hi>Air</hi> which ſurrounds us, what we <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drink, ſleep, watching, exerciſe;</hi> what <hi>goes out of our bodies,</hi> and <hi>what is kept in,</hi> and upon the <hi>Paſſions.</hi> In this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber likewiſe, are rank'd thoſe <hi>foreign bodies</hi> which occur, and are ſometimes uſeful, yet may often diſſolve, cut or break the union of the Parts of ours.

                        <p>If therefore Diſeaſes be only a diſturbance of this Oeconomy, as we may conclude from what he has ſaid before of their Cauſes, Nature

                        <p>Nature's way of acting in ſuch caſes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy her enemy, is to reduce thoſe humours, whoſe diſcord occaſions that of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to their uſual ſtate, whether in relation to their quantity or quality, mixture, motion, the places they are poſſeſs'd of, or any other manner, by which they become offenſive.

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54988:117"/>while things remain ſo, none but a <hi>bad</hi> or <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Criſis</hi> is to be expected, which ſignifies that the diſtemper triumphs, or at leaſt is of equal ſtrength with Nature, which is attended by death, or a <hi>prolongation</hi> of the diſeaſe, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which Nature often has leiſure to attempt a new Criſis, more happy than the former, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having made freſh efforts to advance the concoction of the humours.

                     <p>To be able to make a tolerable gueſs from a Prognoſtick, that is to ſay, to be capable to tell beforehand, that, from the appearance of ſuch and ſuch a thing, this or that ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow, the obſervation ought to be made from its ſeldom or never-failing; one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience alone, or even 2 or 3 being not ſufficient to give an Authority; which cannot be ſaid of all the Prognoſticks of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in general.

                     <p>This is what <hi>Galen</hi> hints at, when he tells you, that one part of theſe Prognoſticks were abſtracted from the Books of Epidemical Diſeaſes. He adds, That if any one deſign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d be to look into the Hiſtories of them, delivered to us by the moſt learned of the Faculty, and from thence draw concluſions ſuitable to his intent. This method in effect wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d prove very good; but to avoid the danger of being miſtaken, twou'd be neceſſary to collect an infinite number of Obſervations on all diſtempers, of what nature ſoever they are, to be able to find out amongſt them a ſufficient number of caſes exactly alike in every ſort of diſeaſe, ſo that he might ſpeak for certain, that in ſuch a diſeaſe, <hi>when ſuch a ſign, or rather ſuch and ſuch ſigns appear, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſhall die; and on the contrary, when he ſees other ſigns, the Patient ſhall eſcape.</hi>

                     <p>For example, if of twenty Patients that in continual Fevers have bled ſeveral drops of blood at the Noſe, or that have but gently ſweated in the head or breaſt, fifteen or eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of them die; and if of twenty that have bled in abundance, and have alſo ſweat all over the body, as many of them have eſcap'd as of the others died, one may generally infer that the firſt accident is of fatal conſequence, and the ſecond a good Prognoſtick. But it does not at all appear, that thoſe that have collected theſe Prognoſticks, and particularly the Prenotions of <hi>Cos,</hi> have always taken care to have as many examples of every caſe as they propoſe wou'd be neceſſary to put a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in.

The advantage which this ancient Phyſician gain'd to himſelf in this point, is, That he cou'd ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the defect of his own experience in the ſervice and aſſiſtance he might receive from that of his Predeceſſors the Sons of <hi>Aeſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius,</hi> ſuppoſing them to be Men of capacity ſufficient for experiences, which to produce as they ought to be, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> has alſo own'd to be very difficult. He was ſo throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of it, that he made no difficulty to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that one might eaſily be deceiv'd, particularly in what relates to Prognoſticks. <hi>Predictions,</hi> ſays he, <hi>in caſes of acute diſeaſes, are uncertain, and no one can juſtly tell whether the Patient will live or die.</hi> In the following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count you'll ſee further proofs of the modeſty and ſincerity of this Author.</p>

                     <p>The firſt thing <hi>Hippocrates</hi> conſider'd, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly when he was concern'd in an acute diſeaſe, was the looks of the Patient. Tis a good ſign with him for a Patient to have the viſage of one in health, and the ſame which the Patient himſelf had when-he was well; as it varied from this, ſo much greater the danger was apprehended to be. This is the deſcription which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> gives of the looks of a dying Man: <q>When a Patient, <hi>ſays he,</hi> has his Noſe ſharp, his Eyes ſunk, his Temples hollow, his Ears cold and contracted, the skin of his Forehead tenſe and dry, and the colour of his Face tending to a pale green, or Lead colour, one may give out for certain that Death is very near at hand; unleſs, <hi>as he adds further,</hi> the ſtrength of the Patient has been exhauſted all at once by long watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or by a looſeneſs, or being a long time without eating The Phyſicians have call'd it the <hi>Hippocratick Face,</hi> to denote that they have taken this obſervation from <hi>Hippocrates.

                     <p>It muſt be own'd <hi>Hippocrates</hi> inquir'd into all theſe things, according to their ſeveral qualities; that is to ſay, to their colour, ſmell and conſiſtence, in relation to the Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous Matter, or what he found out of the common courſe of nature, according to its heat, coldneſs acrimony, <hi>&amp;c</hi> as well as in regard to its quantity; to the Parts from whence it iſſued, the time of its continuance, the manner, and other circumſtances of its iſſuing out. No one can deny but that there were ſome of the things they have mentioned, which he judg'd of by the taſte, they had; not that the judgment was made from his own, but the taſte of the Patient. For example, He drew ſome certain ſigns from the<note n="(a)" place="margin">Lib. de humoribus.</note> Spittle being ſalt or ſweet, and from ſweat, or from tears, or the excrements of the Noſe, which had a ſaltneſs or ſharpneſs.

I ſay there's only this experiment, which ſeems to be out of the power of the Patient to make; but there's no reaſon why the Phyſician ſhou'd not, if he thinks convenient, have it done by thoſe that attend the ſick, or by perſons that are every day employ'd in the moſt vile Offices.</p>

There's alſo another place, where he makes mention of a ſort of a Fever which he calls a ſalt Fever, on which <hi>Galen</hi> makes this remark: That altho ſaltneſs commonly ſhews it ſelf by the taſte, and not by the touch, yet we ought to explain what <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> ſays here, in relation to touching and feeling; that it is not meant of the Patients, but of the Phyſicians, who in feeling his Pulſe perceives ſomething rough or poignant, as if he touch'd ſalt fleſh, or that had been laid in Brine. I believe that one may, in effect, judge of a certain ſort of ſaltneſs by the touch, and that that of the Excrements, which is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in the firſt paſſage that was quoted, may be known by the manner of their pricking the <hi>Anus</hi> at their coming out; but in this caſe 'tis the Patient, and not the Phyſician that can judge of it.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt all the Excrements, the Urine and Stools, were what furniſh'd <hi>Hippocrates</hi> with moſt of the ſigns, which ſerv'd for almoſt all diſtempers. I give you here the chiefeſt of his Obſervations concerning Urine. The Patient's Urine is, in his opinion, beſt, when the ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is to ſay, the thick part, or that which falls to the bottom, is white, ſoft to the touch, and of an equal conſiſtence. If it continues ſo during the courſe of the diſtemper, and till the time of the<note n="(d)" place="margin">See the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Article.</note> Criſis, the Patient is in no danger, and will ſoon be well. This is what <hi>Hippocrates</hi> call'd concocted Urine, or what denotes the concoction of the humours. And he obſerv'd, that this concoction of Urine ſeldom appear'd thoroughly ſo but in the days of the Criſis, which happily put an end to the diſtemper.<note n="(e)" place="margin">Lib. de Criſibus.</note> 
                        <q>We ought, <hi>ſaid Hippocrates,</hi> to compare the Urine with the purulent Matter that iſſues from Ulcers.

That that's black is the worſt, eſpecially if it has an ill ſmell, and is either altogether muddy, or altogether clear. That whoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment is like to large ground Wheat, or to little flakes or ſcales ſpread one upon another, or to Bran, preſages but ill, eſpecially the laſt. The Fat or Oil that ſwims ſometimes upon Urine, and appears in a form ſomething like a Spiders web, is a ſign of a conſumption of the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54988:123"/>fleſh and ſolid parts. The making of a great quantity of Urine is a ſign of a Criſis, and ſometimes the quality of it ſhews particularly how the Bladder ſtands affected.</p>
                     <p>In fine, we ought to obſerve that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> compared the diſpoſition of the Tongue with that of Urine: That is to ſay, when the Tongue was yellow, and charg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d with choler, the Urine of courſe muſt be of the ſame colour. And on the contrary, when it was red and moiſt, the Urine was accordingly of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural colour.</p>
                     <p>The Excrements by Stool that are ſoft, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh, of ſome conſiſtence, and not of an extraordinary ill ſmell, that anſwers to the quantity of whats taken inwardly, and that are voided at the uſual hours, are the beſt ſort of all. They ought alſo to be of a thicker con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, when the diſtemper is near the Criſis, and it ought to be taken for a good prognoſtick, when ſome Worms round and long are evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated at the ſame time with 'em. But tho' the Matter excreted be thin and liquid, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it may give ſome comfortable hopes, provided it makes not too much noiſe in coming out, and the evacuation be not in a ſmall quantity, nor too often, nor in ſo great abundance, nor ſo often, that the Patient is faint with it. All Matter that's watry, white, of a pale green, or red, or frothy and viſcous, is bad. That that's black, like greaſe, and that that's livid like the colour of Verd-de-gris, are the moſt pernicious. That that's pure black, and is nothing elſe but a diſcharge of Choler aduſt, or black Bile, always prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticates very ill, this humour, from what part ſoever it comes, never appearing, but it ſhews at the ſame time the ill diſpoſition of the Inteſtines.</p>
                     <p>The Matter that's of ſeveral different colours, denotes the length of a diſtemper, and at the ſame time that it may be of dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:54988:124"/>
                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> places in the ſame Claſs the Matter that is bilious, or yellow, and mix'd with blood, or green and black, or like the dregs or ſcrapings of the Guts. The Stools that conſiſted of pure Bile, or of all Phlegm, he alſo look'd upon as bad.</p>
                     <p>Matter caſt up by Vomiting ought to be mix'd with choler and phlegm; where you ſee but one of theſe humours alone, 'tis worſe. That that's black, livid, green, or of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of a Leek, is of diſmal conſequence. That that ſmells very ill is ſo likewiſe; and if at the ſame time it be livid, death is not far off. The vomiting of blood is very often mortal.</p>
                     <p>The ſpittings that give eaſe in diſeaſes of the Lungs, and in Pleuriſies, are thoſe that come up readily, and without difficulty; and 'tis good, if they are mix'd at the firſt beginning with a great deal of yellow; but if they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear of the ſame colour, or are red, a great while after the beginning of the diſtemper, and are ſalt and acrimonious, and cauſe violent Coughings, they are not good. Spittings purely yellow are bad; and thoſe that are white, viſcous and frothy, give no eaſe. Whiteneſs is a tolerable good ſign of concoction in regard to Spittings, but they ought not at all to be viſcous, nor too thick, nor too clear. One may make the ſame judgment of the <hi>Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Noſe,</hi> according to their <hi>concoction and crudity:</hi> Spittings that are <hi>black, green,</hi> or <hi>red,</hi> are of very ſad conſequence. In inflamations of the Lungs, thoſe that are mix'd with choler and blood preſage well, if they appear at the beginning, but are bad if they ariſe not till about the ſeventh day. But the worſt of all the ſigns in theſe diſtempers, is, when there is no expectoration at all, and the too great quantity of Matter that is ready to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd this way, makes a rattling in the throat or breaſt. After ſpitting blood, next follows the diſcharge of purulent Matter,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54988:124"/>which is the cauſe of a Conſumption, and at the end death.</p>
                     <p>A kind good ſweat, is that which ariſes in the day of the Criſis, and is diſcharg'd in abundance all over the body, and at the ſame time from all the parts of the body, and carries off the Fever. A cold ſweat is bad, eſpecially in acute Fevers, for in others it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A gentle ſweat or moiſtneſs of ſome Part; for example, of the head or breaſt, gives no relief, but denotes the ſeat of the diſtemper, or the weakneſs of the part. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the Empiricks had not been altogether in the wrong, if they had plainly ſaid that <hi>Hippocrate</hi>'s Philoſophy was none of the beſt, and that they preferr'd the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions all naked as they are, which he gives of Diſeaſes and their Accidents, and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions or Remarks on the manner of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging them to all the Reaſonings they can find any where in his Works, on the Cauſes of the ſame diſtempers. It's certain at leaſt, that 'tis chiefly on this account, I wou'd ſay, on that which the Empiricks look'd upon as the moſt advantageous, that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> has recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended Phyſick to poſterity, and gain'd ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration even from thoſe, that otherwiſe did not conſent with him to his principles, as we have already obſerv'd, and as you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ll afterwards ſee. We may alſo add, That the Books of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> that conſiſt moſt of Reaſoning, or that contain moſt Philoſophy, are thoſe which are attributed to other Authors; as the Book of the <hi>Nature of Man;</hi> that of the <hi>Nature of an Infant;</hi> that <hi>of Winds;</hi> the firſt of <hi>Diet;</hi> and ſome others.</p>
                     <p>As to what remains, we ought to make this Remark, That the Skill of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and of all the Phyſicians that came after him, and that imitated him in relation to <hi>Prognoſticks,</hi>
                        <pb n="227" facs="tcp:54988:126"/>made the people, that knew not how far their knowledge cou'd extend in this matter, look upon them as Prophets, and require of them things that were above their power. Some of them were glad to amuſe the Vulgar, and keep them in this opinion, for the profit they hop'd to gain from it, ſaying, <hi>Since the People are willing to be deceiv'd, ſo let them be.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That that puts ſeveral of our Phyſicians now upon the purſuit of this uncharitable and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable Maxim, is their obſervation, That in effect the World will be deceiv'd; and that they often ſee Phyſicians, that thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves other ways qualified enough to ſatisfie reaſonable Patients, will not become Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers and Mountebanks, are thoſe that have the leaſt buſineſs, or that quit it: And what do they quit it for? To inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves amongſt a wretched ſort of People, that ſometimes can neither write nor read; and that ſome may come ſeeking for them a great way off, to know of them, upon the ſight of a glaſs of Urine, what diſtemper they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, which if the Patient was preſent they cou'd know nothing at all of. When I talk here of the People, I wou'd not have it meant ſimply what they call the Mob or Dregs of the People; the Vulgar, or People, which I mean; meet equally in all conditions, and always makes the greateſt number in all Societies. It happens alſo, I know not how, that ſome Men, that in other things have good Senſe and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and are very skilful in other matters, ſeem to be wholly depriv'd of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Judgment, when it acts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe pretended Prophets, from whom they receive as great impreſſions as the meaneſt of the people.</p>
                     <p>To return to <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> it's a thing very remarkable, and that which adds very much to his Merit and Reputation, that having liv'd in an Age when Phyſick was, as you have
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:54988:127"/>ſeen, altogether Superſtitious, yet ſuffer'd not himſelf to be carried down the Torrent with the reſt; ſo that neither his Reaſonings, or his Obſervations, nor his Remedies, have the leaſt mixture of this weakneſs, ſo common in thoſe Times, and yet common ſtill even amongſt ſome Phyſicians. We don't ſee that his Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticks had any other foundation than from the pure nature of things. It<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s true, in his Book of Dreams, he talks of ſome Sacrifices or Ceremonies which ought to be perform'd to ſome certain Deities, according to the nature of the Dreams we dreamt. But theſe were only Duties, which Religion neceſſarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd Men to. His good ſenſe appear'd in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, particularly when in the ſame Book he ſolves Dreams, by what has been ſaid or done in the day time; from whence he draws conſequences to judge of the condition of the body, according as 'tis charg'd with Choler, Phlegm, Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he brings in as the Cauſes on which depends the difference of Dreams, and the circumſtances that accompany them. We'll ſpeak one word more of the averſion he had to ſuperſtition, in what related to Remedies, and the cure of Diſeaſes, when we come to the Chapter of Purgation.</p>

For my part, <hi>continues</hi> Hippocrates, I believe truly, that theſe ſorts of diſtempers are Divine as well as others, and that there's no diſtemper more Divine or Humane one than another, but that they are all Divine; that every one has its particular nature, and that there is never a one where Nature has not its part. I'll tell you then from whence I think this malady comes. The <hi>Scythians</hi> are ſubject to certain Rheumatiſms on the Joints, which are very ſtubborn, and continue a long time; which happens to them, becauſe they are continually on Horſeback, and their Legs hanging down. When this diſtemper has had its period they become Lame, by reaſon of the contraction of their Thighs, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their management is this. At the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this diſtemper, they open the veins behind the Ears, and being weaken<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>d and diſpirited by the loſs of a great quantity of blood they fall aſleep; and ſome of them, when they awake, find themſelves well. In my opinion, they ruine themſelves by this manner of management, for thoſe that have their veins behind their Ears open<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d, become uncapable of generation; and that's their misfortune. When they come to their Wives and find they are not fit for enjoyment, they are not immediately much concern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d, but when they find they continue impotent, then they imagine they have offended the God, or the Divinity to whom they aſcribe the cauſe of their diſgrace. After which they take the habit of a Woman, and publickly declare they are no longer Men; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the Women, and appear in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:54988:140"/>as ſuch. We muſt obſerve, that there are none but the richeſt of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> or thoſe of the greateſt quality, that are ſubject to this diſeaſe, and that the poor are never ſeiz'd with it; without doubt, the reaſon of it is, becauſe the firſt are almoſt always on Horſeback, and the latter but ſeldom. If this diſeaſe was more divine than others, it ought not to attack the wealthieſt, and the greateſt Men only, but be equally common to all. It ſhou'd rather happen, that the poor People ſhou'd be more expos'd than the rich, eſpecially if the Gods take pleaſure that Men ſhou'd admire and adore them, and for that reaſon beſtow their benefits on them. For the rich offer Sacrifices and Oblations to 'em, ſerve 'em, and erect Statues oftner than the poor, becauſe they have wherewithal to do it; whereas the other have not, and inſtead of adoration oftentimes curſe the Gods, that they have not given them Plenty and Riches. So that it wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d be more agreeable to reaſon, that the poor and needy ſhou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d be puniſh'd with this diſeaſe, for their wickedneſs, rather than the rich. This diſtemper then is truly Divine, as I ſaid at firſt, but all others are ſo too, and come naturally at the ſame time to all People.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The opinion of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> concerning the diſtinction that the Gods ought to make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Rich and the Poor, in relation to Sacrifices, might give an occaſion to ſome to accuſe him of taking too great a liberty in Matters of Religion; but they might as well, and with the ſame reaſon, blame <hi>Homer,</hi> when in ſeveral places he introduces <hi>Jupiter</hi> laying aſide all buſineſs, to go and take part of a Collation; that is to ſay, to ſup up the ſmoak of a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> with all the Train of Gods after him. It appears alſo, by what <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays relating to the cauſe of this diſtemper, that he was not at all ſuperſtitious,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:54988:141"/>as we have obſerv'd before, and his thoughts on this ſubject are very well worthy of the Age in which <hi>Socrates</hi> liv'd, with whom he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt contemporary. It ſeems probable to others, that this diſtemper of the <hi>Scythians</hi> fell upon the Rich oftner than the Poor, by the ſame reaſon that we ſee every day, that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Eſtates are more ſubject to the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriack Affection,</hi> than thoſe of meaner For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, which you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Patient ſpits in abundance, and throws up ſome Worms by the Mouth; his eyes are painful to him, his viſage looks pale, he has a tumour or ſoft ſwelling in his feet, and ſometimes all over the body; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time his breaſt and back pain him, his belly rumbles and makes a noiſe, his eyes look fierce, he hauks and ſpits much, and his ſpittle ſticks to his Throat, that makes his voice ſqueak.</q>

                     <p>The third ſort diſtinguiſhes it ſelf from the reſt, by the <q>mighty quick ſharp pains in the joints, and ſometimes all over the body.

                     <p>The fourth ſort is known by the <q>great tenſeneſs, riſing up, and heat of the belly; after which follows a Looſeneſs, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leads the way to a Dropſie, and is alſo accompanied ſometimes with a Fever.</q>

The Patient ſeldom winks with his eyes, he feels about with his hands upon the Covering of the Bed, as if he wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>So much for the <hi>Typhus;</hi> the <hi>thick or groſs diſeaſe</hi> is no leſs particular, and there is more than one ſort of it. <q>The firſt is caus'd by phlegm and choler, which diſcharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Abdomen and inflate it, and are evacuated up and down like a Torrent. The Patient is taken with a ſhivering and fever; the pain paſſes from the Abdomen to the Head, and when it deſcends to the entrails it cauſes a Suffocation. Sometimes the Patient vomits ſowre phlegm, and ſometimes ſalt; after vomiting he has a bitterneſs in his mouth, red heats appear on his ſide, and he ſtoops in the back; he cannot endure to be touch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>d in any part; and the pain that he feels is ſo violent, that there's a ſort of palpitation or pulſe in the fleſh; his Teſticules are contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the heat and pain is continued at the ſame time, even to the <hi>Anus</hi> and Bladder. He makes thick water, like that of thoſe that are dropſical; the hair falls off from his head, his feet are always cold. At laſt the pain fixes particularly on the ſides, back, and nape of the Neck; and it ſeems to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, as if ſomething creep'd, or run all about his skin. Sometimes there's a remiſſion of the diſtemper, other times there's nothing at all of it. The skin of the head becomes red and thick. This diſtemper continues ſix years, ſometimes ten. Towards the end the Patient ſweats in abundance, and the ſweat is of a very ill ſmell. He has oftentimes pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions in his ſleep, and the ſeed he ejects is bloody, and of a livid colour.</q> It ſeems at firſt as if he was deſcribing the <hi>Cholera Morbus,</hi> or ſome ſort of <hi>Cholick,</hi> but that which comes after has no great relation to that.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſort of the thick diſtempers, <q>is caus'd by bile alone, that diſcharges it ſelf on the Liver and Head. The Liver ſwells up
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:54988:142"/>and preſſes upon the Diaphragm. The Head, and particularly the Temples, are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſeiz'd with pain. The Patient is not right in his underſtanding, and ſometimes he ſees but very little; an Ague and Fever ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed after the foregoing ſymptoms. This comes at the beginning of the diſeaſe, and then you have by times great remiſſions, at other times but ſmall ones. The longer the malady continues, the pain grows greater, the Pupils of the eyes are dilated, and the Patient ſees not a jot; that tho' you put your finger before his eyes he perceives nothing, and does not ſo much as wink. But if he has ſome little ſight remaining, he's continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pulling out with his fingers the little flocks of Wooll from the Covering, thinking they are lice or naſtineſs. But when the Liver extends it ſelf further towards the Diaphragm, the Patient raves, and fancies he has before his eyes all ſorts of creeping things, or wild Beaſts, or arm'd Men; he wou'd fight with them all, and talks and acts as if he was in an engagement. If you don't give him liberty he threatens, and if you let him go he falls down. He has always his feet cold; if he ſleeps 'tis with continual toſſing; he's ſcar'd with frightful dreams, and when he awakes relates all he has done or ſeen. At other times, he lies a whole day and night without ſpeaking a word, breathing with a great deal of difficulty. He is delirious by intervals; he comes to himſelf, anſwers to all queſtions that are ask'd him, underſtands every thing that is read to him, but a little while after relapſes to his former condition. This diſeaſe, <hi>ſays our Author further,</hi> falls chiefly on Travellers, or thoſe that paſſing through uninhabited places, have been frightned with the ſight of ſome Spectre or other.</q>

                     <p>The third ſort <q>is occaſioned by phlegm, which appears by the circumſtances the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is in, who has a taſte as if he had eaten Radiſhes. This diſtemper, or the pain that accompanies it, begins in the Legs, from whence it riſes to the belly, and diffuſing it ſelf in the Inteſtines, makes a great noiſe there; after which the Patient vomits up ſowre putrid phlegm, but this evacuation gives him no eaſe; on the contrary, he falls into a delirium, and feels a pain ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and uneaſie in his bowels, and by times a pain in his head ſo violent and fix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Patient has a pain upon him like that after hard Exerciſe, and his belly feels ſore, as if it was preſs'd with a great burthen: The feet ſwell alſo. If Rain falls on the ground, he can't bear the ſmell of it; and if by chance he's expos'd to the Rain, and ſmells this ſmell of the ground, he immediately falls. This diſtemper has ſome intermiſſions, but laſts longer than the precedent one; its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance is for ſix years.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>We don't find that our Modern Practiſers, nor even thoſe amongſt the Ancients, that came after <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> have deſcrib'd any particular diſtemper attended with ſo many accidents or ſymptoms all at once; and we muſt confeſs, thoſe we are come to ſpecifie are ſo many in number, that one would think it impoſſible for all to happen in one and the ſame diſeaſe.
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:54988:143"/>And that that's yet more particular in it is, that <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> or the Author of the Book we have quoted, makes four or five ſorts of each of theſe diſtempers, which appear ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent one from the other, that we cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend why they are rank'd under the ſame general name.</p>
                     <p>'Tis that is the reaſon that the Phyſicians of After-Ages, that eaſily knew a <hi>Dropſie,</hi> for example, a <hi>Conſumption,</hi> a <hi>Pleuriſie,</hi> by the Characters which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> gave of each, yet knew nothing of the two diſeaſes in queſtion.

'Tis the ſame miſtake that <hi>Galen</hi> found fault with the Empiricks for, who for want of method, had a greater regard to the ſymptoms or accidents, of which there might be an infinite variety, than to the diſtemper it ſelf; whence it came that they multiplied diſeaſes <hi>ad inſinitum.</hi>

                     <p>The ſame defect in method, which was the cauſe that the <hi>Cnidiens</hi> made diſtinctions when there was no neceſſity for it, produc'd that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and confuſion you find in the deſcription of the <hi>Typhus</hi> and <hi>thick Diſeaſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In one word, the fault of theſe Phyſicians lay in this, That they joyn'd the ſymptoms of many diſeaſes to one alone, not diſtinguiſhing thoſe that were proper to certain particular diſtempers, and inſeparable from them, from thoſe which are common to many.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, It may be that the fault was in the Copiers, and that theſe ancient Pieces having paſs'd through an infinite number of hands, have been confuſedly mix'd with obſervations different from them, without the Authors ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any ſhare in the diſorder.</p>
                     <p>We may add to theſe diſtempers, that that's call'd <hi>the great diſtemper of the hollow veins,</hi> and that that's nam'd the <hi>vomiting of the veins on the Brain;</hi> theſe names which were ill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, or that did depend on the particular Idea which theſe ancient Phyſicians had of the Body, having been neither better retain'd, nor known, than thoſe mentioned before.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding this, he does not neglect to make a diligent enquiry into what thoſe that were in health made uſe of for nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in thoſe times. Upon which, I can't for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear making this obſervation, That in thoſe days they were not ſo delicate by much, as we are now, which appears by the care <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> takes to tell what is the quality of the fleſh of a Dog, of a Fox, of an Horſe, of an Aſs, which he wou'd not have done, if at that time they had not been us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d for Eatables, at leaſt by the common People. We will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late here what <hi>Hippocrates</hi> has writ concerning other ſorts of Proviſions, it's ſufficient to know that he examines all thoſe that are now in uſe. For example; Sallads, Milk, Whey, Cheeſe, Fleſh as well of Birds as of four footed Beaſts; freſh and ſalt Fiſh, Eggs, and all manner of Pulſe, and the different ſorts of Grain we feed on, as well as the different ſorts of Bread that are made of it. He alſo ſpeaks very often of a ſort of liquid Food or Broth made of Barley-Meal, or ſome other Grain, which they ſteep'd for ſome time, and boil'd with water; but as this has a regard more particularly to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Dieting the Sick, we'll ſpeak a little more of it in the following Chapter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is full as nice on the ſubject of Drink; he takes a great deal of pains to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the good waters from thoſe that are bad. The beſt, in his opinion, ought to be
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:54988:146"/>clear, light, without ſmell or taſte, and taken out of Fountains that turn towards the Eaſt. The ſalt waters, and thoſe that he calls hard, that is in my opinion heavy, or that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the ſtomach, and thoſe that riſe out of Fenny ground, are the worſt of all; as alſo thoſe that come from melted Snow. But tho' <hi>Hippocrates</hi> makes all theſe diſtinctions, yet he adviſes thoſe that are in health to drink of the firſt water that comes in their way, which agrees with the Advice he gave before, not to be too exact in the manner of living. He ſpeaks alſo, but 'tis but two words, of <hi>Alom Waters,</hi> or that partake of the nature of Alom, and of thoſe that are hot, without enlarging further on their qualities or uſe; we only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by it, that he had a knowledge of Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waters.</p>
                     <p>As to what relates to Wine, he adviſes in ſome places to mix it with an equal quantity of water; and <hi>Galen</hi> obſerves, that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> regulates by that the juſt proportion we ought to keep in this mixture: So that, ſays he, the Wine by its power might drive out what's hurtful to the body, and the water ſerve to temper the acrimony of the humours. But my thoughts are, that he does not treat in thoſe places but of particular caſes, that are there ſtated; and perhaps it was from the vaſt quantity of Wine they drank in thoſe times, where they almoſt never drank it pure. You may ſee alſo, that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> regulating the quantity of the Wine which ought to be drank according to the different Seaſons of the Year, ſays, That in the Summer time you ought to mix a great deal of Water with the Wine, in the Spring and Autumn a little leſs quantity, and in the Winter<note n="(a)" place="margin">

                     <p>Exerciſe, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> adviſes to thoſe that are in health, as well as to thoſe that are infirm, ought to be uſed according to the Rules, and with the Precautions he has ſet forth, which are the ſame we touch'd upon <hi>en paſſant</hi> in the foregoing Book, upon the occaſion concerning <hi>Herodicus,</hi> who we ſaid was the Author of the <hi>Gymnaſtick,</hi> or the Art of Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing, for health.

If I durſt give my opinion with the reſt, I ſhou'd ſay that the Books in queſtion might be of <hi>Herodicus</hi>'s writing, who has paſs'd by the conſent of all the Ancients for the Inventor of the <hi>Gymnaſtick.</hi> However it is, the Advices of the Author of theſe Books, in relation to the Art we are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſpeak of, depend upon the different times one ought to take to walk in, and on the condition the perſon ought to be in before he does it; whether it ought to be faſting, or after eating ſomewhat, in the morning or evening, in the Air, the Sun-ſhine, or Shade; whether he ought to be naked or cloath'd; when he ought to walk ſlowly, and when 'tis neceſſary to run; all this in reſpect to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ages and temperaments, and with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of bringing the body down, of diſſipating humours, or of gaining ſome other advantage from it.</p>
                     <pb n="268" facs="tcp:54988:147"/>
                     <p>Wreſtling, tho' it be a violent Exerciſe, was numbred with the reſt. There's alſo mention made in the ſame place, of a Play of the hands and fingers, which was thought good for health, and call'd <hi>Chironomie;</hi> and of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, which was perform'd round a ſort of a Ball hung up, which they call'd <hi>Corycus,</hi> which they ſtruck forward with all the ſtrength ☞ they had with their hands. You may conſult the above-mentioned <hi>Mercurialis,</hi> that ſearches to the bottom of theſe things.</p>
                     <p>And as you have ſeen in the Chapter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Herodicus,</hi> that Baths were included in the <hi>Gymnaſtick,</hi> as well as the cuſtom of rubbing and anointing ones ſelf, you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>As to what remains, ſeeing health does not depend ſolely on the good uſe, and regular management of Diet, nor on Exerciſe or Eaſe; and that beſides, 'tis of importance to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in other things we have mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when we treated of the Cauſes of Health, ſuch are ſleep, and watchings, the air, and other bodies which are about us; that which ought to be ſeparated from our Bodies, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd there; and laſtly, the Paſſions.

You'll ſee in the Chapter of Purgatives, which you'll come to preſently, other compoſitions of Clyſters, and other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular circumſtances relating to this remedy; we ſhall alſo ſpeak there concerning Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and the manner of preparing them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> alſo advis'd Vomitives as a great preſervative againſt diſtempers, which he caus'd to be taken once or twice a Month, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Winter and Spring-time. The moſt ſimple of them were made of a decoction of Hyſſop, with an addition of a little Vinegar and Salt. He made thoſe that were of a ſtrong and vigorous Conſtitution, take this Liquor faſting, whereas thoſe that were thin and weakly took it after Supper.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaid in the firſt place, <hi>That Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries or Oppoſites are the Remedies of their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites.</hi> That is, ſuppoſing that ſome certain things were oppos'd one to the other, we ought to uſe them one againſt the other.

                        <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of the Remedies which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> made uſe of; and firſt of all of Diet, and of a regular method of Living.</head>
                     <p>DIET was the firſt, the principal, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes the only Remedy, that <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> made uſe of, to ſatisfie the greateſt part of the intentions we have touch'd upon: By theſe means he oppos'd moiſt to dry, hot to cold; he added or ſupply'd what was deficient, and took off from what was ſuperfluous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that that was to him the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:54988:150"/>point he ſupported Nature, and aſſiſted it to overcome the cauſe of the Malady; and, in a word, put it in a condition to do of it ſelf what was neceſſary for the cure of Diſtempers.</p>
                     <p>The Diet of the Sick is a Remedy that is ſo much <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s own, that he was as deſirous to paſs for the Author of it, as of that of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in health, which we have treated of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And the better to make it appear that it is a new remedy, he ſays expreſly, That the Ancients, that is to ſay, the Phyſicians that were before him, had writ almoſt nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Diet of the Sick, having omitted this point, tho' it was one of the moſt eſſential parts of the Art. The method we have ſeen <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> and his Sons make uſe of, in their management of the Sick, in relation to that, is a proof that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpoke truth: To his teſtimony we may join that of <hi>Plato</hi>'s, who endeavours even to juſtifie, in this reſpect, the conduct of theſe firſt Phyſicians, as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd in the ſame place. So that what <hi>Pliny</hi> has ſaid, that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> was the Inventor of the<note n="(a)" place="margin">See above in the beginning of the Chapter concerning <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates.</hi>

                     <p>In Chronical diſtempers, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> Dieted his Patients one way, and in Acute another. In theſe laſt, which are thoſe that require more particularly an exactneſs in relation to Diet, he preferr'd liquid food to that that was ſolid, eſpecially in Fevers; for that he made uſe of a ſort of <hi>Broths</hi> made of <hi>Barly</hi> that was clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to which he gave the name of<note n="(b)" place="margin">

                        <hi>Ptiſane,</hi> wch was a common name as well to theſe Broths, as to the flower of the Grain, of which they
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:54988:150"/>were made. See after what manner the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients prepar'd a <hi>Ptiſane:</hi> They firſt ſteep'd the Barley in Water till it was plump'd up, and afterwards they dry'd it in the Sun, and beat it to take off the husk. After that they ground it, and then having let the flower boil a long time in the Water, they put it out into the Sun, and when it was dry they preſs'd it cloſe. 'Tis properly this flower, ſo prepar'd, that's call'd <hi>Ptiſane.</hi> They did almoſt the ſame thing with Wheat, Rice, Lentils, and other Grain, but they gave theſe <hi>Ptiſanes</hi> the ſame name with the Grain, <hi>Ptiſane</hi> of Lentils, Rice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas the <hi>Ptiſane</hi> of Barley was call'd ſimply <hi>Ptiſane</hi> for the excellency of it. When they had a mind to uſe it, they boiled one part of it in ten or fifteen parts of Water; and when it began to plump in boiling, they added a drop of Vinegar, and ever ſo ſmall a quantity of Aniſe, or Leek, to keep it from clogging, and filling the ſtomach with wind. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> preſcribes this Broth for Women that have pains in their Belly, after being brought to Bed. <hi>Boil ſome of this Ptiſane,</hi> ſays he, <hi>with ſome Leek, and the fat of a Goat, and give it to the Woman in Bed.</hi> You won't find this Ragou very odd, if you reflect on what he has ſaid before of the manner of Living at that time. He preferr'd the Ptiſane to all other food in Fevers, becauſe it ſoften'd and moiſten'd much, beſides that it was of eaſie digeſtion. If he was concern'd in a continual Fever, he wou'd have the Patient begin with a Ptiſane of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different thick conſiſtence, and go on by little and little, in leſſening the quantity of Barley-flower, according as the days drew nearer, when the diſtemper was to be at its higheſt pitch; ſo that then he did not feed the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, but with what he call'd<note n="(a)" place="margin">

                           </gap>. In this time alſo they made uſe of for nouriſhment, Broths made of a ſort of grain, or flower made into little grains, which they call'd in Greek <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>As to what belongs to the quantity of Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the time of giving it, he caus'd the Ptiſane to be taken twice a day by Patients that in their health us'd to eat two Meals a day, not thinking it convenient that thoſe that were ſick, ſhould eat oftner than when they were well. He alſo durſt not allow eating twice a day to thoſe that fed but once when in health, but was willing they might come to't by little and little. In the Fit of a Fever he gave nothing at all; and in all diſtempers where there are exacerbations, he forbid nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment whilſt they continued. He let Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren eat more; and thoſe that were become Men, or Old, leſs, giving nevertheleſs a great deal of allowance to the Cuſtom of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon, or to that of the Country.</p>
                     <p>And tho' he was of the opinion that too much ought not to be allow'd to the ſick, for fear of nouriſhing their diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, yet we muſt obſerve, that he was not of the judgment of ſome of the Phyſicians of his time, who preſcrib'd them long Abſtinence, eſpecially at the beginning of a Fever. The reaſon he produc'd for't was, they weaken'd the Patients extreamly the firſt days of the diſtemper, which oblig'd them afterwards to give them more nouriſhment in the height of their illneſs; which was the time, in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when they ought to give the leaſt.

                        </gap>d not be hurtful to thoſe that were ſick, if taken after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Beſides, he took care to diſtinguiſh the Wines proper in theſe caſes, preferring to all other ſorts White-Wine, that's clear, that has a great deal of water in it, and has neither ſweetneſs nor flavour.</p>
                     <p>This is the Diet that was uſed in acute di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers. As to that in Chronical Diſeaſes,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:54988:152"/>you'll ſee how it differ'd from the firſt by the examples we ſhall bring of the cures of them. We'll only remark before-hand, that Milk and Whey were very much made uſe of on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, whether in lieu of nouriſhment, or that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> look'd upon them as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>
                     <p>We have ſeen before, that Baths and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe were part of the Diet of Perſons in health, it was alſo of thoſe that were ſick. There were many Diſeaſes which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> judged the Bath neceſſary for the cure of; and he ſhews all the conditions requiſite to receive advantage from it, amongſt which theſe are the principal: That the Patient that bathes keep himſelf ſtill and quiet in his place, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking, and let thoſe be doing that bath him, either by throwing water over the head, or by wiping him dry; and that they keep for this laſt purpoſe Sponges, inſtead of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument which the Ancients called <hi>Strigil,</hi> which ſerv'd to rub off from the skin the dirt and naſtineſs which the Oils or Unguents they anointed themſelves with left upon it. That they take care before-hand not to catch cold. That they do not bath themſelves immediately after eating or drinking; and that they abſtain alſo from eating and drinking immediately after they come out of the Bath. That regard ought to be had, whether the Patient has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed himſelf to bath in his health, and whether it did him good or hurt. Laſtly, That they abſtain from bathing, when the body is too open or too coſtive, or if they have not diſcharg'd before, or are too weak; if they have inclinations to Vomit, or a great loſs of Appetite, or that they bleed at Noſe. The advantage you receive from the Bath, and the good it does, according to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in moiſtening and refreſhing, in taking away wearineſs, in making the skin ſoft, and the joints pliant; in provoking Urine, and in
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:54988:152"/>making the Noſtrils moiſt, and other Pipes open. He goes as far as two Baths a day in his allowance, to thoſe that are accuſtom'd to't in their health. We'll ſpeak afterwards of a ſort of particular Bath, or half Bath, in the Chapter concerning external Remedies.</p>
                     <p>As to the Exerciſe of the Sick, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> approv'd of it very much in Chronical diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, as you'll ſee by ſome examples of Cures which we'll ſpeak of hereafter; tho' he thought it not convenient in acute diſtempers, and openly blam'd his Maſter <hi>Herodicus,</hi> who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigu'd even thoſe that were in Fevers with violent Exerciſes, as we have obſerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>He was of opinion, for example,<note n="(c)" place="margin">De ratione victus in acutis.</note> that purging was good in a Pleuriſie, when the pain was below the Diaphragm, giving in this caſe <hi>black Hellebore,</hi> or ſome <hi>Peplium</hi> mix'd with the juice of <hi>Laſerpitium,</hi> which was our

                     <p>The principal Rule <hi>Hippocrates</hi> gives relating to Purgation is this: <hi>That you ought only to purge off the humours that are concocted, and not thoſe that are yet crude, taking particular care not to do it at the beginning of the diſtemper, leſt the humours ſhould be ſtirr'd up, or very much</hi>

                           </gap>, which is a term that expreſſes properly the motions of Animals. The greatest part of the Commentators are of opinion, that his meaning was to deſcribe a ſudden motion of the humours, which ſwell up and endeavour to diſcharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of ſome ſide, or throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on ſome part. <hi>Aphor. 22.

                        <hi>diſturb'd, which happens pretty often.</hi> The underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Axiom depends on what has been ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the concoction of humours in the Chapter of Criſis's. By the beginning of a diſtemper, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> meant all the time that paſs'd from the firſt day to the fourth compleat. He was not the firſt that made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that it wou'd be of ill conſequence to ſtir the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, or purge before that time; we have ſeen, in the firſt Book of this Hiſtory, that the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Phyſicians had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made this obſervation, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> might have learn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d it from <hi>Democritus,</hi> who had continued a long time in that Country, or he might have travell'd there himſelf, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that the <hi>Aſclepiades,</hi> his Predeceſſors, had not alſo made this diſcovery themſelves.</p>
                     <p>There is another Aphoriſm, which appears diametrically oppoſite to the precedent one; 'tis that, where tis ſaid, That in the beginning of diſtempers we ought to ſtir the humours: that is to ſay, to purge what we think we ought to be ſtirr'd. This Aphoriſm has given a great deal of trouble to the Phyſicians of the ſucceeding Ages, who have endeavour'd to
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:54988:154"/>reconcile it with the firſt. <hi>Galen</hi> has got off from the matter on this occaſion, by explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word <hi>to ſtir up,</hi> to ſignifie uſing all the Remedies that are neceſſary for the eaſe of the Patient; amongſt which, he reckons particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly bleeding and purging. So that the <hi>ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up,</hi> which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> adviſes in this Aphoriſm, in his opinion is perform'd by the firſt of theſe Remedies, rather than by the laſt; that is to ſay, Purgation might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſometimes at the beginning of diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, but very rarely. But a third Aphoriſm, which explains that which we are going to quote, appears contrary to the ſenſe of <hi>Galen,</hi> 'tis the <hi>twenty-fourth</hi> of the <hi>firſt Section,</hi> which ſays, <hi>That we ought ſeldom to purge in acute di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, and do it in the beginning, after having carefully examin'd if the caſe requires it. Galen</hi> ſalves the apparent contradiction between this Aphoriſm and the firſt, by ſaying that it is in diſtempers that continue a long time, that we ought always to wait the concoction before we purge, but that in acute ones we may do it at the beginning when the humours are turgid. And he adds, that the caſe being rare, it's what obliges <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to caution, that you examine well into all things on this occaſion, before you uſe this Medicine.</p>
                     <p>It actually appears, that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> purg'd ſometimes at the beginning of acute diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; and beſides the Aphoriſm we have juſt now read, he ſays in another place in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms, <hi>That we ought to purge at that time in Fevers, when the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine of the Patient is troubled, but we ought to abſtain from it if it be clear.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, we muſt agree, that he did it rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as matters went. That which has been ſaid at the beginning, that amongſt a great number of perſons ſick of theſe diſtempers, which he ſpeaks of in the Books we have quoted, he finds but very few of them to whom he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Purgatives, is at leaſt a proof of it.</p>

                     <p>Beſides, he gives this important Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which has ſome relation with the firſt Aphoriſm,<note n="(a)" place="margin">De ratione victus in acut.</note> That thoſe that endeavour to take off inflamations in a part by purging Remedies, draw nothing from the Part where the infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is, by reaſon of the great tenſeneſs of it, and becauſe the diſtemper is yet crude; on the contrary it diſſolves, or corrupts that that remain'd found in the Part, and that held out againſt the diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>We muſt alſo obſerve, that <hi>Hippocrates,</hi>
                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">Aphor. 9. Sect. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>before he Purg'd any one, wou'd have them make their body or their humours fluid;</hi> that is, that they wou'd dilute them ſufficiently, to the end they might be more eaſily evacuated.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, he ſaid, That we ought to give to the Cholerick, or in cholerick diſtempers, Medicines to purge choler; in Phlegmatick, thoſe that purge phlegm; in Melancholick, thoſe that purge melancholy, or black choler; and in the Dropſie in particular, thoſe that purge the Waters.</p>
                     <p>He added, <hi>That we knew if a Purgative had drawn from the body what was fit to be evacuated, according as we found our ſelves well or ill upon it.

                     <p>Perhaps he was afraid of bleeding in Fevers, becauſe he ſuppoſes, as it appears by ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, that Fevers were produc'd by the Bile and the Pituita, which grew hot, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heated the whole body, which is, ſays he, what we call a <hi>Fever,</hi> and which in his opinion could not be evacuated by <hi>bleeding.</hi> He looks elſewhere upon the preſence or abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Bile as an objection againſt bleeding.

                     <p>We are not therefore to be ſurprized, if in all his Book of epidemical diſtempers we find but few directions for bleeding in the acute diſtempers, and particularly in the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of continual and burning Fevers there treated of.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt and third Book, which are the moſt finiſhed of all, we find but one ſingle inſtance, and that in a Pleuriſie, in which two he ſtaid till the eigthth day of the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>

                        <hi>Galen</hi> accounts otherwiſe for his Conduct in this caſe,<note n="(q)" place="margin">In lib. 2. Epidemic. 3. Comm. 1.</note> Hippocrates <hi>having ſaid nothing of bleeding, not only in the caſe of</hi> Pythion, <hi>but likewiſe of ſeveral other Patients who ſeem'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own principles to want bleeding, as far as we can judge of them by his writings; We muſt neceſſarily conclude, either that he did not bleed them at all, or that he omitted the mention of it in the Hiſtory which he gives of their Caſes. Now it is not likely that he omitted bleeding when the caſe required it, this great man being ſo fond of that Remedy, as appears by thoſe Works of his, which are acknowledged by all the World to be Genuine, ſuch as the Aphoriſms, the method of Diet in acute diſtempers, and that we have now in hand, where he ſays thus;</hi> I open'd a Vein in the Arm upon the eighth day, and let out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of blood, as was neceſſary: <hi>If he blooded upon the eighth day in the caſe here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, we have ſtill more reaſon to believe he did it in the preceeding.</hi> On the other ſide, it is not probable that he ſhould forget to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, in a caſe wherein it was his ordinary practice, eſpecially when he puts down Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of much leſs importance, not omitting ſo much as a <hi>Suppoſitor. Since therefore,</hi> ſays Galen, <hi>there lies ſome difficulty upon either of theſe opinions, we ought to determin for that which has leaſt. This being ſuppoſed, I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that it was uſed to ſeveral of theſe Patients, but that the mention of it was omitted in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:54988:161"/>of their caſes, as a thing ſuppos'd of courſe. And I rather ſubſcribe to this Opinion, becauſe</hi> Hippocrates <hi>himſelf takes expreſs notice of bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the eighth day, which I imagin he peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly remark'd, becauſe it was a thing againſt the uſual practice, ſuppoſing the mention of bleeding the preceeding days, as being the common me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods.</hi>

                     <p>Moſt of the modern Commentators upon <hi>Hippocrates</hi> are of <hi>Galen</hi>'s opinion: But to this it may be anſwer'd, that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> being very exact, as <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf acknowledges, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the relation of the moſt Minute Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines he us'd, ſuch as <hi>Suppoſitors;</hi> 'tis hard to think in this caſe he would omit the moſt conſiderable. To this we may add, that <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> himſelf maintains elſewhere, that <hi>Eraſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus,</hi> of whom we ſhall ſpeak hereafter, never blooded any body, only for this reaſon, that in ennumerating the Medicines he made uſe of in ſeveral occaſions, he makes no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bleeding. If this Argument will hold againſt <hi>Eraſiſtratus,</hi> it will againſt <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> Beſides, it was altogether of as great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that we ſhould be inform'd of the Remedies, as of the Proceſs of the diſtempers.

                     <p>In all probability where <hi>Hippocrates</hi> omits the mention of bleeding in any caſe, he did not uſe it, nor is this ſo much againſt his principles, as <hi>Galen</hi> would inſinuate. On the contrary, he follows him therein preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as appears by what has been ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Hippocrates</hi> had blooded his Patients plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully in Fevers in the beginning of their illneſs, as <hi>Galen</hi> pretends, he would not perhaps have had the opportunity of ſeeing ſo many Fevers terminate by <hi>Criſis,</hi> that is, by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

                     <p>There was a third ſort of Medicine, which was betwixt Liquid and Solid, which was a ſort of <hi>Lambitive,</hi> which they were forced to keep ſome time to diſſolve in the Mouth, that they might ſwallow it leiſurely.

                     <p>By all this we may ſee what ſort of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Medicines Hippocrates</hi> uſed.

The Author in that Book quoting others which treat of <hi>Medicaments only.</hi> Theſe Books bore the title of <hi>Pharmaca;</hi> and <hi>Pharmacitis,</hi> ſays our Author, <hi>ut Scriptum eſt in Pharmacis,</hi>

Galen</hi> obſerves, that thoſe ſort of Books were very rare in thoſe days, becauſe the Ancient Phyſicians uſed to give a Receipt of the Medicines they uſed, with the Hiſtory of the diſtemper they uſed them for.</p>
                     <p>Another thing which is worth our Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is, that the compound Medicines of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> were but very few, and conſiſted of very few Simples, four or five at moſt.

We have already ſeen <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>'s diſtinction between <hi>Fevers</hi> that were not <hi>ſymptomatical,</hi> but were of themſelves <hi>the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal diſtemper,</hi> and thoſe which <hi>attended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamations.</hi> We have obſerv'd, that in the firſt ſort of Fevers <hi>Diet</hi> was the only Medicine, he not thinking it neceſſary neither to <hi>bleed</hi> or <hi>purge,</hi> or do any thing more than nurſe them after the manner below laid down.</p>
                     <pb n="318" facs="tcp:54988:172"/>
                     <p>We have ſeen likewiſe the uſe he made of bleeding and purging in <hi>inflamations,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Pleuriſie</hi> and <hi>Peripneumonie,</hi> and his cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the uſe of them.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt of theſe diſtempers he attempted to abate the pain of the ſide, or to diſſipate the peccant matter, by applying Fomentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the part. In the caſe of the man that was not blooded till the eighth day of his Pleuriſie, he takes expreſs notice that the <hi>Fomentations had not at all abated the pain,</hi> which ſuppoſes him to have begun with them. <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations</hi> were, and have been a long time, almoſt an univerſal Remedy, and the uſe of <hi>Oyls, Oyntments, Cataplaſms,</hi> and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Medicines was near as common, as the ſequel will ſhew. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> did not only apply theſe Medicines to the part affected in the Pleuriſie, whoſe ſeat is in the ſide:<note n="(a)" place="margin">De dlaeta in acutis.</note> He cauſed almoſt all the body, and particularly the Loins and Thighs to be anointed. Of thoſe remedies which he gave inwardly in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, he appears to have relied moſt upon thoſe which promoted<note n="(b)" place="margin">De locis in hom</note> ſpitting. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes alſo the following remedy.<note n="(c)" place="margin">Diaeta acutis.</note> 
                        <hi>Take,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Sothernwood, Pepper, and black Hellebore, boyl them in Vinegar and Honey, and give it in the beginning of the diſtemper, if the pain be urgent.</hi> He preſcribes in the ſame caſe, as alſo in infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of the Liver, and pains about the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm, <hi>Panax</hi> boyl'd in the ſame Liquor; and intimates that theſe Medicines ſerve to looſen the Belly, and ſo provoke urine; ſo that black Hellebore ordered in the firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, muſt not be taken for a true purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, becauſe it would have been againſt his principles, but for a Medicine that only looſens the Belly gently, and was about the ſtrength of a Clyſter. In another place he allows urine<note n="(d)" place="margin">See the Chapter of Diet.</note> to his Pleuriticks, ſo it be not a ſtrong Wine, and it be well diluted. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it likewiſe in a ſort of <hi>inflamation of the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:54988:172"/>Lungs</hi> and in a <hi>Lethargy,</hi> which makes me the leſs ſurprized at his ordering <hi>Pepper</hi> in a Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſy; and which is an argument that the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of cooling, or the fear of heating, were not the ſtrongeſt conſiderations upon which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> acted in the cure of acute diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; although he recommends elſewhere to Pleuriticks, a drink made of Water and Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, into which he ſometimes put a little Honey, with an intention to moiſten and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectorate. Perhaps this <hi>Pepper</hi> Medicine was one of the empirical Remedies before ſpoken of, the experience whereof he had without the reaſon.</p>
                     <p>In a <hi>Peripneumonie,</hi> or <hi>inflamation of the Lungs,</hi> his practice was much the ſame, as in a <hi>Pleuriſie.</hi> We have ſeen before that he let blood frequently. We ſhall only take notice here, that he endeavoured to clear the Lungs by Medicines, that attenuated or incided vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcid matter, and help'd expectoration. He particularly for this purpoſe, directs an<note n="(e)" place="margin">See the preceeding Chapter.</note> 
                        <hi>Electuary</hi> compoſed of <hi>Pine-apples, Galba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> and <hi>Attick Honey.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have ſeen that he ordered bleeding for thoſe that ſuddenly loſt their Speech, or who had any ſumptoms of an <hi>Apoplexy, Palſy,</hi> or <hi>Convulſions,</hi> and other diſtempers of the like nature. After this he orders <hi>vomiting,</hi> and a purge of a great quantity<note n="(f)" place="margin">To the quantity of a dozen, and ſometimes of ſixteen <hi>hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae.</hi> See the Chapter of Purgers.</note> of Aſſes Milk. But this latter Remedy ſeems rather deſign'd for thoſe that were recovered of theſe diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, or had overcome the firſt fit. The <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations</hi> likewiſe muſt have been uſed in the beginning.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Convulſions</hi> in particular he gave <hi>Pepper,</hi> and <hi>black Hellebore</hi> in <hi>Chicken Broth.</hi> He made them <hi>ſneeze, bath, foment</hi> and <hi>anoint</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.<note n="(g)" place="margin">De locis in homine.</note> In another place he orders <hi>a fire to be made on both ſides the patients bed,</hi> and gave him <hi>Mandiake Root</hi> in a ſmall quantity, and applied Bags very hot to the Tendons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:54988:173"/>without ſpecifying what Tendons he means.</p>
                     <p>In a <hi>Quinzy</hi> he opened the Veins of the <hi>Arm,</hi> and under the <hi>Tongue</hi> and <hi>Breaſts.</hi> He gave <hi>Lambitives</hi> and <hi>Gargles,</hi> which they were to uſe hot, and uſed Fumigations as we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice already. He adviſes <hi>ſhaving</hi> the Head, and to lay a <hi>Plaiſter</hi> to it, as likewiſe the Neck, which was alſo to be fomented and covered with Wool.<note place="margin">lib. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>(h)</hi> In great peril of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focation he pierced the Wind-pipe, and put a Reed or Pipe into it. When the diſeaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to abate, he purged with <hi>Elaterium,</hi> to prevent a relapſe. He began the cure of an <hi>Ileos</hi> by <hi>Vomiting</hi> alſo; tho in this diſtemper they vomit of themſelves too much, as we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that he did in a <hi>Cholera,</hi>
                        <note n="(i)" place="margin">See the Chap. of Vomitives.</note> which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a diſeaſe whoſe chief ſymptom is vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Afterwards he let blood from the Veins of the Arm and of the Head, and cool'd all the Diaphragm, not the Heart excepted; and warm'd all thoſe below<note n="(k)" place="margin">See the Chapter of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note>, by placing the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in a veſſel of warm water, and afterward anointing him continually with Oyls, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying Cataplaſms as hot as might be endured. He uſed alſo upon theſe occaſions Suppoſitors eight inches long, made with Honey only, and rubb'd at the end with Bulls Gall. This Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitor having drawn away the neareſt excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he gave a Clyſter. But if the Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory had no effect, he thruſt up the <hi>Anus</hi> the ſnowt of a pair of Bellows, and having blown up the Belly and Inteſtines, he drew the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and gave the Clyſter. He gives a caution that this Clyſter be made of things which do not heat very much, but ſuch as diſſolve the excrements: and after it is taken, he orders the <hi>Anus</hi> to be ſtopt with a Sponge, and the Patient be put into warm water, and keep the Clyſter as long as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>He begins his <hi>Cronical</hi> diſtempers with the <hi>Exſiccating</hi> diſeaſe deſcrib'd before, and taken
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:54988:173"/>notice of as a kind of a <hi>Hypochondriacal affection.</hi> For the cure of this evil, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> propoſed firſt <hi>walking</hi> and <hi>exerciſe;</hi> and in caſe of weakneſs, to make uſe of ſome <hi>carriage,</hi> and to make ſhort Journeys. He adds, that they ought to take <hi>vomits</hi> and <hi>purges</hi> frequently, to uſe <hi>cold Bathing</hi> in Summer and to <hi>anoint</hi> in Autumn and Winter, with Oyls; to drink <hi>Aſſes Milk</hi> or <hi>Whey,</hi> to abſtain from meats, either <hi>ſweet</hi> or <hi>oyly,</hi> and to uſe <hi>cooling things,</hi> and ſuch as <hi>keep the Belly looſe,</hi> and to take <hi>Clyſters.</hi> He mentions<note n="(k)" place="margin">

                     <p>THe body of Women being made otherwiſe than that of Men, as likewiſe its peculiar diſtempers; theſe depend chiefly upon the <hi>Matrix,</hi> and are very numerous, as we may ſee by the liſt before given. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> has attributed a great number of theſe to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing of the part aforeſaid, which he ſuppoſes might not only be relax'd, and hang out, but that it might likewiſe be retracted as far as the Liver or Heart, and even to the Head, or turn Its Orifice to the right or left, or backwards or forwards. Of all theſe motions, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> which was accompanied with the moſt diſmal ſymptoms, was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of it, whereby it aſcended and preſs'd the Liver, the Head, and the upper parts; this producing in Women a ſudden change of Colour, grating of the Teeth, and other ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms like Epileptick, a difficulty of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even to abſolute ſuffocation, a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſenſe, and an univerſal cold, like death.</p>
                     <pb n="327" facs="tcp:54988:176"/>
                     <p>To remedy this, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> order'd the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of Belly to be ſwathed, preſſing the Matrix gently downwards, and forcing open their Mouths, poured down the richeſt Wine, and after they were come to themſelves, gave them a purge, and after that Aſſes Milk. If the diſeaſe was obſtinate, after having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Matrix to its place, he gave them a decoction, in which was Caſtor, Conyza, Rue, Cummin of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> Rhadiſh-Seeds, Sulphur and Myrrh. He burnt under their Noſes likewiſe ſtinking things, ſuch as Wooll, Pitch, Caſtor, Brimſtone, Leather, Horns, and Feathers, and the ſnuff of a Lamp juſt extinguiſh'd, with intention to fetch them to themſelves, to make them ſweat, and to reſtore the Matrix. In the mean time he anointed below with ſweet Oyls, and Liquid Perfumes, ſuch as that which he call'd<note n="(a)" place="margin">See the Chapter of exterior Reme. dies.</note> 
                        <hi>Neto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum.</hi> He likewiſe uſed divers other Remedies both internal and external, amongſt which we muſt not forget the <hi>Peſſaries.</hi> Theſe were a ſort of <hi>Suppoſitors</hi> to thruſt up the Neck of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix;<note n="(b)" place="margin">

In the diſeaſe before mentioned, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> made Peſſaries made with <hi>Caſtor, Myrrh, Peucedà<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, Pitch, Melanthium,</hi> and ſometimes even<note n="(c)" place="margin">A ſort of a Fly reſembling Cantharides. There was likewiſe an Herb of this name.</note> the <hi>Brupreſtis,</hi> and <hi>Cantharides,</hi> mixing all theſe with Oyntments and Wool.</p>
                     <p>It is obſervable, that the uſe of Peſſaries was very common among the Ancients, and that it was almoſt the univerſal Medicine in Womens caſes. They us'd it almoſt for all intentions, to <hi>relax,</hi> to <hi>lenifie,</hi> to <hi>draw,</hi> to <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate,</hi> to <hi>cleanſe,</hi> and <hi>dry</hi> the Matrix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> uſing ſometimes Oyls and Fat, ſometimes the juice of Herbs, ſometimes things very irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as <hi>Nitre, Scammony, Tithimale, Garlick, Cummin, Cantharides,</hi> and the like, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reſtringents, as the <hi>Rind</hi> and <hi>Flower</hi>
                        <pb n="328" facs="tcp:54988:177"/>of <hi>Pomgranates, Sumach,</hi> and ſometime <hi>Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,</hi> and Plants of ſweet Smell.</p>
                     <p>Nor was it in the ſuffocation of the Matrix only that theſe Peſſaries were in uſe, but in all other diſtempers of that part. They were imploy'd to provoke or check the Menſes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Relaxations, ſuperfluity of Humours, Ulcerations, and Inflamations, the Dropſie, <hi>Fluor Albus</hi> and Sterility; they procur'd A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortions and brought away dead Children, and the Secundines, and promoted the purgations of Women after Labour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

This noiſe according to him was of leaſt danger when on the Left ſide, and the inciſion made there with more ſafety. if the thickneſs of the Fleſh, and the quantity of the Pus, hinderd him from hearing the noiſe, he choſe that ſide on which the inflamation and pain had been greateſt: he made his inciſion rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind than before, and as low as he could: and having firſt open'd the skin between two

The Pus being by this means drawn away in ſufficient quantity, he ſtopt the Wound with a Tent of Linnen faſtned to a ſtring, and for ten days together drew every day ſome Pus.

                        <hi>CHAP. XXVII.</hi> Of the Writings of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>COncerning the Writings of this Ancient Phyſician, there are three things chiefly to be obſerv'd. Firſt, The eſteem they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways met with. Secondly, The diſtinction between thoſe Writings which are legitimate, and thoſe that are ſuppoſititious. Thirdly, His Language and Stile. In the firſt place the Writings of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> have been always had in particular veneration. <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, <hi>that what</hi> Hippocrates <hi>has deliver'd has always been eſteemed as the word of a God, and aſſures us, that if what he writ be a little obſcure thro his brevity, or if he ſeems in certain places to have omitted ſome little things, he has nevertheleſs written nothing which was not very much to the purpoſe. The Works of</hi> Hippocrates, ſays Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, <hi>are very well known to all that ſtudy Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; we have ſuch a reſpect for them, that they think what he has ſaid, to come out of a Divine Mouth, and not a Human.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A plain mark of the eſteem that all Ages have had for the Writings of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is, that there is ſcarce any Author who has had ſo many Commentators. Amongſt the moſt Ancient of them, <hi>Galen</hi> ſpeaks of one <hi>Aſcle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piades, Rufus Epheſius, Sabinus, Metrodorus, Satyrus, Heraclides, Tarentinus, Heraclides Erythraeus,</hi> and one <hi>Zeuxis,</hi> to whom we may add <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf, and <hi>Celſus,</hi> who have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tranſlated him word for word.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall mention another party of theſe Authors in the ſequel. He has had undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſeveral others among the Ancients, without reckoning thoſe that explain'd his obſcure words, as we ſhall ſee by and by
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:54988:184"/>And the number of the Moderns is greater, as we ſhall ſhew in its proper place.</p>
                     <p>To come to the diſtinction of the true Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> from the ſpurious, we ſhall begin with a Liſt given by <hi>Erotian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Author, who liv'd under <hi>Nero,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing the Books of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> or thoſe which paſt for ſuch in his time, according to the ſubject of which they treated, ennumerates the following. <hi>The Books,</hi> ſays he, <hi>which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the Doctrine of ſigns, are the Book called the Prognoſtick, two Books of Predictions, (which two latter are not</hi> Hippocrates<hi>'s, as we ſhall ſhew hereafter,) and the Book of the Humours. The Books which relate to Phyſick, and which are the moſt rational, are the Book of the winds, of the Nature of Man, of the Epilepſie, of the</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Children, <hi>of times and ſeaſons. The Books concerning the manner of treating diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, are the Book of fractures, of the articula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of ulcers, of wounds, and darts of wounds, of the head, of the Phyſicians repoſitory, that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Mochlicus of the Emeroides</hi> and <hi>Fiſtula's,</hi> of <hi>diet, two of diſeaſes, of Ptiſan, of the laces or parts in man, two Books of Womens diſtempers, one of barren Women, one of Nouriſhment, and one of Waters. The Aphoriſms and ſix Books of Epidemick diſeaſes, treat of mixt matters. Thoſe which follow concern the Art in general; the Book entituled the Oath, that called the Law, and that of the Ancient Phyſick.</hi> As for his <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors Speech</hi> and the <hi>Speech at the Altar,</hi> they ſerve only to prove the kindneſs of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> to his Country, but concern not Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick at all. <hi>Galen</hi> ſpeaks of one <hi>Artemidorus Capito,</hi> and one <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> both of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> who collected and publiſhed the works of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> together.</p>
                     <p>He adds, that this Edition had the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Emperor <hi>Adrian,</hi> under whom they liv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:54988:185"/>taking too much liberty, and changing ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral words of the Text, which they did not underſtand. VVe don't certainly know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Catalogue of the Books of <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> publiſh'd by theſe Authors, were greater than that which <hi>Erotian</hi> gives us, but tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable it was, ſince <hi>Galen,</hi> who follow'd them very near, mentions ſeveral Books of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>'s, or that paſt for his, whoſe names are not met with in <hi>Erotian</hi>

                        </gap>eſe Books are, that of <hi>Affections</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>internal Affections,</hi> and two others of <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> Beſides thoſe mentioned by <hi>Erotian. Galen</hi> ſpeaks alſo of an <hi>Addition</hi> to the Book call'd <hi>Mochlicus,</hi> which is the Book we now have of the <hi>nature of the Bones.</hi> He ſaw like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Title of the Book of the <hi>Glands,</hi> which paſt for <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s, though <hi>Galen</hi> thought it ſpurious. He acknowledg'd like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Book, entituled, <hi>Tht Seven Months Birth,</hi> the following, which is, <hi>of the Eighth Months Birth,</hi> being but a part of the former. <hi>Galen</hi> ſeems alſo to ſpeak of ſeveral Books of <hi>Diet,</hi> whereas <hi>Erotian</hi> quotes but one. And although that he believed not that the <hi>prenoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Cos</hi> were <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s, 'tis apparent that they paſs'd commonly for ſuch in his time, and that the ſeventh Book of <hi>Epidemick diſeaſes,</hi> was likewiſe generally received, tho <hi>Galen</hi> lookt upon't as manifeſtly ſpurious.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Suidas,</hi> the lateſt <hi>Greek</hi> Author, ſpeaks this of the books of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> at the end of the paſſage before cited. The firſt, ſays he, of the books of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> contains the <hi>Oath,</hi> the ſecond his <hi>Predictions,</hi> the third the <hi>Aphoriſms,</hi> a work above human capacity. The fourth contains that admirable collection which goes by the name of <hi>Hexecontabiblos,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>conſiſting of ſixty Books,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all the reſt that relates to Phyſick and Philoſophy.</p>
                     <pb n="345" facs="tcp:54988:185"/>
                     <p>We have yet remaining as many as <hi>Suidas</hi> reckons, thoſe whoſe Titles are found neither in <hi>Erotian,</hi> nor that I know of in <hi>Galen,</hi> are the following. The Book of the <hi>Nature of a Woman,</hi> of what <hi>relates to Virgins,</hi> of the <hi>Seed,</hi> of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> of <hi>Superfaetation,</hi> of the <hi>time of Childrens breeding of teeth,</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> of the <hi>Sight, of</hi> the <hi>Eye,</hi> of <hi>Anatomy,</hi> of the <hi>manner of drawing dead Children out of the womb,</hi> of the <hi>Phyſician,</hi> of <hi>decent habit,</hi> and of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>We ſhall not trouble the Reader with all the Criticks have ſaid concerning the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the true Writings of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> from the counterfeit, or ſuppoſititious. We ſhall only take notice that ſeveral were already ſuſpected in the time of <hi>Galen,</hi> and <hi>Erotian</hi> himſelf, amongſt thoſe which they give us the liſt of. Some of theſe Books have been aſcribed to the <hi>Sons of Hippocrates;</hi> others to his <hi>Son-in-Law,</hi> or to his <hi>Grandſons,</hi> or to <hi>his Diſciples,</hi> or to his <hi>Predeceſſors,</hi> as the book of <hi>Articulations,</hi> and of <hi>Fractures,</hi> which ſome have thought to have been writ by his Grandfather, who was of the ſame name, tho others have maintained that this firſt <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> wrote nothing. They have likewiſe aſcrib'd them to other Phyſicians, who lived either before, or at the ſame time with him,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:54988:186"/>and to the Philoſophers, as <hi>Democritus,</hi> who is ſuppos'd to be Author of the book of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man. <hi>Galen,</hi> with abundance of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, imputes this <hi>fathering of Books and Titles,</hi> ſo frequent among the Antients, to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs of the firſt Copyers, and he tells us that the conſiderable ſumms, which the Kings <hi>Attalus</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who vied who ſhould have the fineſt Library, gave to thoſe that brought them the writings of great men, gave occaſion to this falſifying of Names and Authors, and to the confuſion we find in the diſpoſition of antient works.</p>
                     <p>As we have ſaid we ſhall not amuſe ourſelves with the judgment of the Criticks. Thoſe that have a mind may conſult <hi>Mercuria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> who has written particularly upon that ſubject.</p>
                     <p>It will be of uſe however to take notice that to thoſe ſuppoſitions which we have ſpoken of muſt be attributed the contradictions found in ſome of the opinions of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> ſome being directly oppoſite to others.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place we obſerve that<note n="(b)" place="margin">See the Chapter of the ſigns of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</note> theſe books of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> which are of the beſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning are the moſt ſuſpected.</p>
                     <p>We muſt further take notice, that thoſe <hi>pieces</hi> before call'd <hi>Strange,</hi> which are annexed to the works of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> are moſt part of them, and perhaps all of them ſpurious, as we ſhall ſhew more particularly in the following Chapter.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Style</hi> and <hi>Language</hi> of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> which is the third thing to be examin'd, we muſt not wonder that <hi>Capito</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> did not always underſtand <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> tho they were native <hi>Greeks. Erotian,</hi> who liv'd under <hi>Nero,</hi> had compoſed a Gloſſary, that is, a <hi>Dictionary of the Obſcure and Obſolete words</hi> us'd by him, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>AFter having ſpoken of the Writings of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in general, we ought to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min thoſe pieces which are tackt to them, and which, as we have ſaid, appear under the title of Aliens. We have already ſeen wherein they have conſiſted, and ſhall begin with the two diſcourſes mention'd by <hi>Erotian,</hi> as being the moſt Ancient. That which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpoke at the Altar of <hi>Minerva,</hi> is addreſs'd to the Communities and Cities of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> to
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:54988:188"/>whom he complains, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> had a deſign to reduce the Iſle of <hi>Cos</hi> to their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and prays their ſuccour in that preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing danger. His diſcourſe is very ſhort. That of <hi>Theſſalus</hi> on the other ſide is very long. It is addreſs'd to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and puts them in mind of the ſervices they had receiv'd from the Predeceſſors of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> for a long time, and likewiſe from <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> himſelf, and from his Family. The obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation which the <hi>Athenians</hi> are ſuppos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d to have had to theſe later, were firſt, that the Father refus'd to go to the <hi>Illyrians</hi> and <hi>Paeons,</hi> who had deſired him and offer'd him great ſumms to come and free them from the <hi>Plague,</hi> which Ravaged their Countries; and having foreſeen by the Courſe of Winds, that this diſeaſe would reach <hi>Greece,</hi> he ſent his Sons, his Son-in-law, and his Scholars thro all the Provinces, to give them neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to prevent taking the infection and went himſelf into <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> and a little time after to <hi>Athens,</hi> where he did them great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſo far acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they preſented <hi>Hippocrates</hi> with a <hi>Crown of Gold,</hi> and initiated him and his Son, who ſpeaks in the Myſteries of <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerpine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He remonſtrates to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that they were further obliged to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and to <hi>Theſſalus</hi> himſelf, in that this latter by the command of his Father, followed the Fleet of <hi>Alcibiades</hi> into <hi>Sicily,</hi> in quality of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, making all neceſſary preparations for the Voyage at his own charges, and refuſing the Salary that was offered him.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the Principal Articles by which <hi>Theſſalus</hi> endeavours to make the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſenſible how much they were oblig'd to his Family. We ſhall examin only that of the <hi>Plague,</hi> which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> foreſaw coming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Greece,</hi> in which there is this difficulty.
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:54988:188"/>Firſt, the time is not fix'd, and we find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in other Authors concerning any Plague coming from the ſide of <hi>Illyria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aetius</hi> indeed takes notice that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> being at <hi>Athens</hi> at the time of a Plague, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to <hi>light great Fires in the Streets to purifie the Air, and make it more dry. Galen</hi> alſo reports the ſame of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> upon the like occaſions, ſaying, that he ordered <hi>great Fires to be made in divers parts of every City in</hi> Greece, <hi>in which they were to caſt Flowers, Herbs and Drugs of ſweet ſcent.</hi> But herein there is this Eſſential difference, that he brings the Plague which he ſpeaks of from <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> indicating thereby the great Plague ſo well deſcribed by <hi>Thucidides,</hi> which he ſays preciſely came from the ſame part. But <hi>Ethiopia</hi> is directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to <hi>Illyria,</hi> one being on the South of <hi>Greece,</hi> and the other on the North.</p>
                     <p>It may perhaps be alledged, that there might be a miſtake in the place from whence the Plague came, the thing yet being the ſame in fact. But if we will have this Harangue of <hi>Theſſalus</hi> to ſpeak of the great Plague of <hi>Athens,</hi> two great difficulties will ariſe upon it. The firſt is, that the Author laſt cited, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be credited, takes notice that the Plague was ſo furious, eſpecially at <hi>Athens,</hi> that there was no great reaſon to brag of the Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Phyſick. On the contrary, he aſſures us, <hi>that the Phyſicians themſelves were puzzled, and they died indifferently with a Phyſician or without, that the Phyſicians themſelves died faſter than others, as converſing more with the Sick</hi> In this caſe I do not ſee what honour <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſhould gain.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond difficulty is that, if <hi>Hippocrates</hi> were at <hi>Athens</hi> at that time he muſt be born long before the Eightieth <hi>Olympiad,</hi> which is the time of his Birth according to <hi>Soranus,</hi> by which account he muſt be but thirty year old, in the ſecond year of the <hi>Peloponeſſian</hi> War,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:54988:189"/>and of the Eighty ſeventh <hi>Olympiad</hi> the time of that Plague, and conſequently he could not have Sons old enough to practice Phyſicks, and a Daughter married to a Phyſician his Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
                     <p>To come nearer to the matter, we muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the account of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who ſays that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> flouriſhed in the eighty ſixth <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad;</hi> or of <hi>Aulus Gellius,</hi> who ranks him with <hi>Sophocles, Euripides,</hi> and <hi>Democritus;</hi> who, according to him, were a little older than <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates.</hi> All Authors agree, that <hi>Socrates</hi> was born about the end of the ſeventy ſeventh <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad. Democritus</hi> was but a year older, but <hi>Euripides</hi> was born the ſeventy fifth <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and <hi>Sophocles</hi> the ſeventy third <hi>Olympiad.</hi> We ought therefore to make <hi>Hippocrates</hi> at leaſt as old as the Tragick Poet, that what is ſaid of him concerning the Plague of <hi>Athens</hi> may be true; for by this account he would be fifty years old, and conſequently it was not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to have Sons that practiſed Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick. But it is more likely, that what <hi>Aetius</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> or the Author of the book concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Theriaca,</hi> which is amongſt his Works, deliver, is falſe; and that they impute to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> what<note n="(a)" place="margin">See above Book. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>225.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Plutarch,</hi> with more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of truth, aſcribes to <hi>Acron,</hi> who lived long before <hi>Hippocrates</hi> If there were any other Plague which came from the ſide of <hi>Illyria,</hi> we know nothing of it.</p>
                     <p>However it were, the <hi>Decree of the Senate of Athens,</hi> another piece of the ſame nature of the former, but more recent, ſpeaks of a Plague which came into <hi>Greece,</hi> out of the Barbarous Countries, wherein <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and his Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars did very great ſervice; and it is added therein, that the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> ſending for him into his Dominions, which were infected with the ſame diſeaſe, and promiſing to load him with Honours and Riches; he deſpiſed his offers, and refuſed to go, looking upon him as
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:54988:189"/>Barbarian and an enemy to <hi>Greece,</hi> whereupon the <hi>Athenians</hi> in recompence of the uſeful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he had given them, and of his Affection for <hi>Greece</hi> in general, honoured him with an initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in the grand Myſteries as they had done <hi>Hercules</hi> before, gave him a Crown weighing a thouſand peices of gold, the freedome of <hi>Athens,</hi> and the right of being main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all his life at the publick expence in the <hi>Prytaneum,</hi> granting further to all the youth of the Iſle of <hi>Cos</hi> the liberty of coming to <hi>Athens,</hi> and being brought up and inſtructed with the youth of that City.</p>
                     <p>This was the purport of the <hi>decree of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of Athens.</hi> What relates to the meaſures taken to invite <hi>Hippocrates</hi> into <hi>Perſia,</hi> is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the teſtimony of divers letters, which are pretended to be written upon that ſubject by the Miniſters of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to inform him of the great reputation of <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> and to adviſe him to ſend for him, and by <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> himſelf, in purſuance of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, or by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who anſwers haughtily to all the promiſes that are made him, <hi>that he has in his own Countrey whereupon to live, that he was not allowed to poſſeſs the riches and grandeur of the</hi> Perſians, <hi>nor to cure Barbarians that were enemies to</hi> Greece. There are alſo other letters expreſſing <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his reſentments of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>'s conduct, and terrible menaces to the Inhabitants of the Iſle of <hi>Cos,</hi> in caſe they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſend <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to him to be chaſtized; and the anſwer of thoſe generous Iſlanders, who were not at all frighted at them, proteſted they would not deliver up their Citizen whatever might happen.</p>
                     <p>What makes the credit of theſe letters ſtill more to be ſuſpected is, that <hi>Theſſalus</hi> when in his ſpeech he upbraids the <hi>Athenians</hi> with the obligations the <hi>Greeks</hi> had to his father, would undoubtedly not have failed to have turn'd theſe letters to his honour, if there had been
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:54988:190"/>any truth in them. But allowing ſome ſhew of truth to thoſe pieces which we have here examin'd, we muſt not paſs the ſame judgment upon the other letters, ſuppoſed to be written or received by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> or others upon his account. They are certainly the work of ſome half-learned <hi>Greek,</hi> compoſed out of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, or out of deſign to get money. Some of theſe, to whom <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writ were <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paemen, Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Halicarnaſſus, Cratevas, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magetas,</hi> King <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and King <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> without reckoning <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Pheſſalus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> As for <hi>Philopaemen,</hi> 'twould be hard to think that he meant the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous General of <hi>Achaia,</hi> becauſe he was not born till about a hundred years after the death of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> Much leſs can we think that the <hi>Dionyſius</hi> he has ſpoken of, was the famous Hiſtorian of <hi>Halicarnaſſus,</hi> who liv'd under <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> But to what King <hi>Demetrius</hi> could <hi>Hippocrates</hi> write, ſince in his time there was none ſuch in the world. The firſt of the name being <hi>Demetrius Poliorcetes</hi> the ſon of <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> one of the ſucceſſors of <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom <hi>Hippocrates</hi> could no more have ſeen, than the former. The ſame may be ſaid of <hi>Cratevas,</hi> who liv'd at the ſooneſt but in the age of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates,</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> as we ſhall ſee hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Author of theſe letters having heard of a famous <hi>Botaniſt</hi> of that name, or having ſeen his works, thought he might very well make <hi>Hippocrates</hi> write to him without inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf whether he or <hi>Demetrius,</hi> or the reſt aforegoing, lived in his time or no. We find another ridiculous Anachroniſm at the head of <hi>Marcellus Empiricus</hi> his book, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be directed to <hi>Maecaenas</hi> by the ſame <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> But though we had not theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing proofs of the ſpuriouſneſs of theſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, we need only read them to be ſatisfied they were not <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s. And I think a learned modern Phyſician too modeſt when

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:54988:191"/>thoſe that ſent for you were fools, and not I.</hi> Thereupon <hi>Democritus</hi> delivers in two words his opinion in Philoſophy, concerning the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages</hi> or <hi>Species</hi> diffuſed thro' the air, of which his books as he ſays makes mention. He tells <hi>Hippocrates</hi> afterwards, that a Phyſician ought not to judg of his Patient by the aſpect only, for in that caſe he <hi>(Democritus)</hi> ſhould have run the riſque of paſſing for a mad man in his judgment. He concludes with telling <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> that he had ſent him back the book which this Phyſician had written concerning madneſs, which book is immediately annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after this letter. It conſiſts but of one page, which is nothing but a repetition of ſome lines of <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s book of the <hi>falling ſickneſs,</hi> which is likewiſe cited in this.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond letter, or the ſecond book of <hi>Democritus</hi> addreſs'd to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> is intituled <hi>of the nature</hi> of man, which is the title of a book written by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> which has been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd to <hi>Democritus,</hi> as we have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. This book or letter is very near twice as long as the former. It contains an enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the principal parts of the body, and the offices they perform.

                     <p>There is but one letter of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus</hi> now extant, which is much ſhorter than the two abovementioned. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it he tells him, that if the Phyſicians at any time ſucceeded in this art, the people aſcribed it to the Gods, but if they miſcarried, they uſed to lay the blame upon them. <hi>I have,</hi> ſays Hippocrates, <hi>got more ſcandal than honour by my practice, and tho' I am advanced in years, yet I have not attained to perfection in this art, and even</hi> Aeſculapius <hi>himſelf, the inventer of it, never carried it ſo far.</hi> After this he takes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:54988:191"/>briefly to mention his journey to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus,</hi> teſtifies for him that he is far from being mad, and deſires him to write to him often, and to ſend him the books he had compoſed.</p>
                     <p>The letters of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to <hi>Damagetus</hi> give a more particular account of his converſation with <hi>Democritus,</hi> when he went to cure him, one of them is very long, in it he gives <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getus</hi> an account of his voyage, and all that happen'd to him till his return. We have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſeen in the preceeding book the occaſion of this journey, and the ſucceſs of it. I ſhall ſay no more of it for fear of being thought too prolix; only give me leave to remark that theſe letters have nothing of the ſtile of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates.</hi> It may be eaſily imagined that the pretended madneſs of <hi>Democritus,</hi> and the journey with <hi>Hippocrates</hi> undertook with a deſign to cure him, afforded matter enough to make a ſort of a Romance. To conclude, I don't know who this <hi>Damagetus</hi> was.</p>
                     <p>The letter to King <hi>Perdiccas</hi> is of the ſame ſtamp with the reſt, that is to ſay, equally ſpurious. We there find, as well as in that which is addreſs'd to King <hi>Demetrius,</hi> ſome Anatomical obſervations, and ſome maxims relating to Phyſick, which however don't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be taken notice of, except a few that are drawn out of the writings of <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> as we ſaid in <hi>Soranus,</hi> died at <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> a City of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> at the ſame time with <hi>Democritus,</hi> being fourſcore and ten years old, or fourſcore and five, or a hundred and four, or according to others, a hundred and nine. He was buried between <hi>Gyrton</hi> and <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> and his ſepulchre is ſhown to this very day, where a ſwarm of bees has fixed for a long time, the honey whereof Nurſes come to fetch to cure their children of the Thruſh. He is drawn in ſeveral pictures, having his head co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a bonnet, like that of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> which is a mark of nobility, or elſe with his cloak, for which ſome aſſign this reaſon, that it was to hide his bald head, others that his head was tender, or elſe to ſhow that this part, which is the ſeat of the ſoul, ought to be well guarded, or to ſhow that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> loved travelling (for it was only upon this occaſion and in that of war, or in caſe of ſickneſs, that the ancients had their heads covered) or to ſignifie the obſcurity of his writing, or to inſtruct us that even in time of health, we ought to avoid whatever may hurt us. In ſhort, others believe that the reaſon why he threw his cloak about his head, was that it might not hinder him in his buſineſs. There are great diſputes about his genuine works, for Authors differ about them, and indeed it is a hard matter to ſay any thing certain of them upon ſeveral accounts. Firſt there is a great deal of difficulty in the <hi>words</hi> he uſes. Secondly in his <hi>Phraſe</hi> or ſenſe, for that is a thing that changes, and we write after another manner when we are young, from what we do in our old age. <hi>Soranus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with ſaying that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> did not
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:54988:193"/>love money, that his behaviour was grave and courteous, that he had a particular affection for the <hi>Greeks,</hi> of which he gave evident proofs in freeing whole Cities from the plague, for which ſervices he had all the reſpect imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhown him. He adds, that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> left two Sons, <hi>Theſſalus</hi> and <hi>Draco,</hi> who were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very famous in the ſame profeſſion, and a great number of diſciples.</p>

                     <p>Theſe Cities for the moſt part were but very ſmall, properly ſpeaking they were but ſo many Towns, ſo that one of them was not ſufficient to maintain a Phyſician.<note n="(c)" place="margin">In libr. de articul. C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>To come now to the <hi>Elogiums</hi> which anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity beſtow'd upon him in a ſuperlative man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he has not only paſſed by almoſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal conſent for the Prince of Phyſicians, but his opinions were reſpected as Oracles, and we have already obſerved what a particular eſteem they paid to his writings. He has
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:54988:194"/>ſhared with <hi>Plato</hi> the title of <hi>Divine,</hi> nay, he has this advantage over that Philoſopher that he was call'd <hi>the divine old man,</hi> by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, and without naming his name, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they uſed to ſay <hi>the Divine Plato.</hi>

                        <hi>a man ought to underſtand Phyſick ſo well, as to make as few miſtakes as poſſible; conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that in this profeſſion he is moſt to be be commended, who commits the feweſt errours;</hi> which ſuppoſes that no man is exempt from them. <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerve that <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> has ſomewhere own'd, that he was once miſtaken in probing a wound in the head thro' the ſutures of the ſcull, which had made him believe that the bone was broke.

                        <hi>Quintilian</hi> commends him upon the ſcore of this very ſame ingenuity.

                     <p>'Tis not to be queſtion'd but that there were ſeveral Phyſicians in the time of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates.</hi> The number of Phyſicians, or at leaſt of thoſe that bore that name, was always great. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> has obſerv'd it himſelf, where he ſays <hi>that there were ſeveral Phyſicians by name, but few that were ſo in reality,</hi> But we ſcarce know any of either ſort that lived at the ſame time with <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion having wholly effaced theirs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Galen</hi> mentions four Phyſicians, who he ſays lived partly before <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the ſame time. Their names are <hi>Phaon</hi> or <hi>Phaeon, Euryphon, Philiſtion,</hi> and <hi>Ariſton.</hi> I don't know who the firſt was.

                     <p>As for <hi>Philistion</hi> he might very well paſs for the contemporary of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> ſince he was the maſter of <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> the <hi>Cnidian,</hi> who flouriſhed in the CIII. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> of whom we ſhall ſpeak hereafter.

                     <p>As for the humane body, he thought that its firſt formation commenc'd from the ſpinal marrow, which marrow was afterward cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a bone, and theſe bones with fleſh. In conſequence of this, he held that the links which joyned or faſtened the ſoul to the body were in that marrow, which he call'd the ſeat of the mortal ſoul. The reaſonable ſoul he lodged in the brain, which he ſaid was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of that marrow, and look'd upon it as a ſoil purpoſely prepar'd to receive the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſeed. As for that part of the ſoul upon which depend Generoſity, Valour and Anger, he plac'd it near the head, between the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragme and the neck, that is to ſay, in the breaſt; or in the heart, in which he followed <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> He held that the lungs encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the heart to refreſh it, and to calm the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent motions of the ſoul which was lodged there, as well by the refreſhment which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Air in reſpiration, as from the liquor which we drink, which he ſuppoſed to fall in part into the lungs;<note n="(c)" place="margin">Gell. llb. 17. cap. 11. Macrob. lib. 17, cap. 15.</note> which made one of the Ancients ſay, that <hi>Plato</hi> gave poſterity occaſion to laugh, by meddling with that which was not his buſineſs. But he that ſaid this did not conſider that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and other Phyſicians before ſpoken of, were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of this opinion, and that <hi>Plato</hi> apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoke only after them.</p>
                     <p>This Philoſopher imagined alſo another part or ſort of ſoul, which deſired not only meat and drink, and all that was neceſſary for the body, but which was the Principle of all appetites or deſire in general. This ſoul was poſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Diaphragm and the Navel, it was quartered in the loweſt part, and fartheſt from the head, that it might not by its agitations and commotions, diſturb the reaſonable ſoul, which is the beſt part of us, in its meditations
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:54988:200"/>and thoughts for the common good.

                     <p>The opinion of this Philoſopher concerning the manner of reſpiration is no leſs peculiar. He believed that there was no <hi>vacuum</hi> in the world, but that the Air which eſcaped out of the Lungs and Mouth, in reſpiration meeting that which ſurrounds the body without, puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es it ſo, that it forces it to enter thro' the pores of the skin and fleſh, and to inſinuate it ſelf into the moſt remote parts of the body, till it fills the place which the other left, after which making the ſame way out again by the Pores, it forces that without to enter by the mouth into the lungs in inſpiration. We ſee by this that <hi>Plato</hi> confounded tranſpiration with reſpiration, pretending that both one and t'other were performed together, as it were by two ſemicircles.</p>
                     <p>As for the fleſh, he thought it compounded
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:54988:201"/>of water, fire and earth, and a certain ſort of ſharp leaven, biting and ſalt.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are ſome of <hi>Plato's</hi> thoughts of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body in its natural ſtate. As for the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of its deſtruction, which are diſeaſes, old age and death, he ſuppoſed in the firſt place that the bodies which are about ours, diſolv'd and melt it continually, after which every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which gets looſe or exhales, returns to the principle from whence it was drawn; he ſuppoſes in the ſecond place that <hi>the blood which is,</hi> according to him, <hi>a fluid matter form'd of the Aliments by a peculiar artifice of nature, which cuts and reduces them into ſmall pieces, by means of</hi>

                        <hi>fire, which riſes in our ſtomach after the air or breath.</hi> He ſuppoſed that this blood, whoſe redneſs was an evident token of the impreſſion of this fire, ſerved to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the fleſh and generally the whole body, and to fill up the vacant ſpaces of it, as it were by a ſort of watering, or general inundation.</p>
                     <p>This being ſuppoſed, he maintained that while we were young, this bloud abounding in all parts, not only ſupply'd what was diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated or diminiſhed of the fleſh, which as was ſaid was perpetual; but after having fill'd up what was wanting, it furniſh'd matter of increaſe to the maſs of the body, from hence it is, that in our youth we grow and become larger, but when we are advanced in years, more of the ſubſtance of our body is ſpent, than the bloud can ſupply or reſtore, therefore we diminiſh by degrees.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe principles alſo of which our bodies conſiſts, which <hi>Plato</hi> calls Triangles, which in our youth were ſtronger than thoſe of which the Aliments were compounded, reducing them eaſily to a ſubſtance like themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come diſunited and relaxed, by having ſo long endured the ſhock of other triangles, this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes old age, which is followed by death, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where the triangles, whereof the ſpinal
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:54988:201"/>marrow conſiſts, are diſſolv'd and diſunited, ſo that the bands by which the ſoul was faſten'd to it, are intirely broken, and let it looſe.</p>
                     <p>As for diſeaſes which attack us in all ages, and precipitate the uſual time of death, he ſuppos'd that our bodies being compoſed of the four Elements before named, the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of theſe Elements were the chief cauſes of them. Theſe diſorders conſiſted in the exceſs or deficiency of any of theſe Elements, when they did not preſerve the proportion of their firſt mixture, or when they changed place, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their own place for another.</p>
                     <p>To explain himſelf more particularly, he adds, that the fire exceeding, produced conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual and burning fevers, that if the air over-ballanced, it produced quotidian intermitting Fevers. If the Water, Tertian Fevers, and if Earth Quartanes. The Earth being the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt of all the Elements, muſt have quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the time to move it ſelf in that the fire has and the reſt of the Elements in proportion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plato</hi> did not confine himſelf to theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals only, but proceeded to the particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the changes that befall our bodies in relation to the bloud and humours which are the immediate cauſes of diſtempers. While the bloud, ſays he, maintains its natural ſtate, it ſerves to nouriſh the body and to preſerve health. But when the fleſh begins to corrupt or to melt, and diſſolve the humour which comes from it, entring into the veins, carries this corruption along with it, and changing the bloud in ſeveral manners, turns it from red to yellow; and bitter, or ſower or ſalt; ſo that that which was pure Bloud, becomes part Bile and Phlegm or Seroſities. What we call Bile, ſays <hi>Plato,</hi> is particularly produced from the diſſolution of the old fleſh, it is an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that aſſumes divers forms, and is very changeable both as to colour and taſte, but it is chiefly diſtinguiſhed into two ſorts, the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:54988:202"/>Bile which is bitter, and the black Bile which is ſowre and pricking. As for the Phlegm and Seroſities, or Water, <hi>Plato</hi> ſeems to confound them, or to make but one ſort of humour of them. The Phlegm accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to him, is produced from the new fleſh, and the ſeroſities or waters, which are deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the particular names of ſweat or tears, are only the phlegm melted or diſſolved. In another place he ſeems to confound the phlegm and ſeroſities with the Bile, when he ſays, that what we call ſowre phlegm, is the ſame thing with the ſeroſity of the black Bile But in the explication of the effects of theſe humours, he reſtrains himſelf to the two principal, which are<note n="(h)" place="margin">See Pag.</note> the Bile and the Phlegm, and he acknowledges that theſe two juices by their mixture with the blood are the cauſes of all diſtempers.</p>
                     <p>When the Bile evaporates outwards, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges it ſelf upon the skin, it cauſes divers ſorts of humours, attended with inflamations, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call'd<note n="(i)" place="margin">See Pag.</note>

The Bile is eſpecially hurtful when it is mixed with the blood, it breaks the orders of the Fibres which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him ſmall threads ſcatterd thro' the blood, that it might be neither too clear nor too thick, to the end that on the one ſide it ſhould not evaporate, and on the other, might always move eaſily in the veins. This Bile continuing its havock, after having broken the fibres of the blood, pierces to the ſpinal marrow, and deſtroys the links of the ſoul before ſpoken of, unleſs the body, that is to ſay, all the fleſh, melting or diſſolving, breaks its force. When this happens, the Bile being overcome, and obliged to depart the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, throws it ſelf thro' the veins upon the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er belly and the ſtomach, from whence it is diſcharged by ſtool and vomiting, like thoſe

If this Phlegm mixes with the black Bile, and penetrates into the receptacles of the brain, it cauſes the Epilepſie or Falling-ſickneſs.</p>
                     <p>The ſowre or ſalt Phlegm is the cauſe of all diſeaſes, comprehended under the name of <hi>Catarrhs</hi> or <hi>Rheums,</hi> and brings diſorder and pain upon what part ſoever it falls.</p>
                     <p>We muſt here take notice of the <hi>Idea</hi> which <hi>Plato</hi> had of the <hi>Matrix</hi> or its properties, and ſome of its diſeaſes.<note n="(m)" place="margin">See Pag.</note> the <hi>Matrix,</hi> ſays he, is <hi>an Animal, which longs impatiently to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and if it be long diſappointed of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fruit, is is enraged, and runs up and down the whole Body, and ſtopping the paſſages of their Air, it takes away reſpiration, and cauſes great uneaſineſs, and an Anfinite number of Diſeaſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe were the ſentiments of <hi>Plato</hi> upon the cauſes of diſeaſes, upon all which we ſhall not trouble our ſelves to make reflections. We ſhall confine our ſelves only to what he ſays concerning the Acidity and ſaltneſs of the humours, it being of importance to our Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to take notice of it, becauſe of the ſeveral Syſtems that have been ſince built upon that foundation. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> had before ſpoken of the ſowre and the ſalt, but he has mention'd them only upon the account of their effect, without ſhewing their Original, which <hi>Plato</hi> ſeems to have diſcover'd, and therein to have made an improvement upon him.</p>

<pb n="390" facs="tcp:54988:207"/>imagine, but becauſe it is the reſervatory of the blood and ſpirits. He formally maintains<note n="(p)" place="margin">l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But if <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> attributes ſuch noble uſes to the heart, the brain was in his opinion but a heap of Water and Earth, without blood and without ſenſe. The office of this Cold Lump was, ſays he, to refreſh and moderate the heat of the heart. But beſides that, he gives elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where this Office to the Lungs, he does not account for the manner how the brain ſhould be capable of diſcharging it. And altho' the brain be plac'd immediately upon the ſpinal marrow, and fix'd to it, yet he pretended that the ſubſtance of that marrow was-quite different from that of the brain, being a ſort of blood prepar'd for the nouriſhment of the bones, and conſequently hot, whereas the other was cold. He made otherwiſe ſo little of the brain, that if he did not abſolutely reckon it amongſt the excrements, he thought it ought not to be ranked amongſt the parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which had any continuity or union with the reſt, that he look'd on't as a ſubſtance of a peculiar nature, and different from all the reſt of the body.</p>
                     <p>As for the reſt of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> as the Liver, the Spleen, and the Kidneys, he thought that their firſt and chief uſage was to ſupport the veins, which would be pendulous but for them, and to ſtrengthen them in their place. Beſides this firſt uſe, he aſſigned them ſome others. The Liver helped to the digeſtion of the meat in the ſtomach and the guts, by the warmth which it imparted to thoſe parts; of which we ſhall ſpeak more particularly in the Sequel. The Liver was not of ſuch univerſal uſe, and is, according to him, but accidentally neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to collect and concoct the Vapours which riſe from the Belly; hence it is, that Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, in whom theſe vapours take another
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:54988:207"/>courſe, have but a very ſmall Spleen, as Birds, and Fiſhes, whoſe feathers and ſcales are form'd and nouriſh'd out of this moiſture. And theſe Animals for the ſame reaſon, ſays he, have neither kidneys nor bladder.</p>

As Plants, ſays the Philoſopher, draw their nouriſhment by their
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:54988:208"/>Roots, which are diſperſed in the Earth, ſo Animals draw theirs by theſe veins, which are as ſo many Roots, to draw from the Belly and Inteſtines the juice therein contained, theſe parts being to Animals as the Earth is to Plants. He ſays alſo, That theſe veins are branches of the great veins, and of the <hi>Aorta</hi> which go to the inteſtines. As for the <hi>Omen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, Ariſtotle</hi> thought that it aſſiſted in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the Liver to the concoction of the Meat, warming the parts to which it is contiguous with its Fat which is hot.</p>
                     <p>In explication of what has been already ſaid, he held farther, that the Coction of the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments was performed partly in the ſuperior Venter, and partly in the inferiour, that the maſs of the Aliments being yet too freſh, and not being ſufficiently concocted, while it is in the ſuperior Venter, that is, the Stomach, and being depriv'd of all its Juice, and all that is uſeful in it, ſo that nothing remains but thick excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when it comes at the bottom of the inferiour Venter, there muſt neceſſarily be ſome ſpace between theſe two, in which the nouriſhment is changed, and is neither crude nor excrement. This ſpace, ſays he, is the thin Gut called <hi>Jejunum,</hi> which is immediately joyned to the ſuperior Venter, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence lies between that Venter, wherein the Aliments were in part crude, and the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the inferiour Venter which contained nothing but excrement.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the places, according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> wherein digeſtion is performed. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion was, according to him, a ſort of Elixa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, he thought, that the Aliments were prepared in the body, much after the manner that meat is boyled in a Pot, by means of the heat of the Neighbouring parts, the chief of which were, as we have obſerved, the Liver and the Cawle.</p>
                     <pb n="394" facs="tcp:54988:209"/>
                     <p>We may ſee by this Gut which he calls <hi>Jejunum,</hi> and the diſtinction, that he makes elſewhere between the <hi>Colon,</hi> the <hi>Caecum</hi> and the <hi>Rectum,</hi> that the Guts were ſomewhat better diſtinguiſhed than in the time of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> who ſeems to have acknowledged but two, the <hi>Colon</hi> and the <hi>Rectum,</hi> as we have already taken notice.</p>
                     <p>The uſe of the Lungs and manner of reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> were theſe. The Heart being inflated by too much heat, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged the Lungs and Breaſt to ſwell and move, and by conſequence to receive in the Air, which inſinuating itſelf into the heart, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed it in its entrance, and returning carried off the thick hot vapours exhaling from it, and ſerv'd at the ſame time to form the voice, the Air being neceſſarily obliged to enter into the Lungs as they riſe for fear of a void, which is a thing nature abhors.</p>

For, adds he, the place about the Brain, or the Brain (an uſual manner of expreſſion among the <hi>Greeks</hi>) is naturally moiſt, and when any foreign Spirit gets in, it does violence after it is got in, and forces the natural moiſture into the veins, cauſing it to turn round, ſo that this Spirit has the ſame effect, as if any body turn'd the Head round, it being indifferent whether it be done inwardly or outwardly.</p>

For, ſays he, the Spirit is the cauſe of heat and motion, ſo that if it becomes motionleſs, the blood or moiſture neceſſarily grow chill. And for this reaſon we find the Feet be numm'd, and ſometimes the upper parts, when they are preſſed by a Chair, or any other way, this compreſſion ſtopping or interrupting the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that it cannot move as uſual, cauſes the Blood to grow cold.</p>

But the Chronological Errors which we have detected upon the occaſion of the pretended Letters of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> ſhew that we are not to rely much upon proofs of this nature, this Letter of <hi>Diocles</hi> being no leſs to be ſuſpected than the others. Thoſe that place <hi>Diocles</hi> in the time of <hi>Darius,</hi> Son of <hi>Hyſtaſpes</hi> are manifeſtly in an errour. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have gone on the other ſide too low, if I be not miſtaken. But however it be, we find in this Letter rules for preſervation of health, which conſiſt in foreſeeing Diſeaſes by certain ſigns, and preventing them by certain Remedies. The Body is there divided into four parts, the Head, the Breaſt, the
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:54988:212"/>Belly, and the Bladder; and there are Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines there preſcrib'd to preſerve theſe parts, from their uſual Diſtempers. He preſcribed Gargariſms to purge the Head and Frictions. For the Breaſt he adviſes vomiting after Meals, and Faſting. He ordered the Belly to be kept open, not by Medicine, but by proper Diet, ſuch as Blites, Mercury, Garlick boyled, the Herb <hi>Patience,</hi> Colwort Broth, confections with Honey. For the diſtempers of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he appointed ſome Diuretick Medicines, ſuch as the Roots of Selery and Fennel boyl'd in Wine, with the water of the Decoction of <hi>Daucus Smyrnium,</hi> of Elder or Chiches.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Diocles</hi> wrote ſeveral Books of Phyſick which are loſt. Amongſt the reſt was one of Diſeaſes, their Cauſes and Cure, a fragment of which is cited by<note n="(d)" place="margin">De Locis affect. lib. 3. c. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Galen,</hi> concerning the Diſeaſe called the Melancholick or Flatulent Diſeaſe, wherein <hi>Diocles</hi> ſpeaks thus. There is a Diſeaſe, whoſe ſeat is about the Stomach, which ſome call Melancholy, others Flatus, or Wind, in which, after eating things hard of digeſtion, men ſpit abundance of very clear Spittle; their Belches are ſowre, with Wind and heat in the Hippocondria, with a rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling motion, not at firſt, but ſometime after, and often violent pain in the Stomach, which extend in ſome even to the back. After the Meat is perfectly digeſted all ceaſes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns again after eating. The ſame ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms ſometimes take a man faſting, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times after Meals, and force him to throw his victuals undigeſted up again, and ſometimes bitter hot phlegm, or ſo ſowre as to ſet their Teeth an edge. Theſe diſtempers for the moſt part come in youth; but come when they will, they hold a long time. We may ſuppoſe they that are troubled with it, have too much heat in the veins which receive the nouriſhment from the Stomach, and that the Blood which they contain is thereby thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:54988:213"/>For it is plain that thoſe veins are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed or ſtopt, from this ſenſible proof that the nouriſhment is not diſtributed thro the body, but remains crude upon the ſtomach, inſtead of paſſing into the Channels which ought to recieve it, and going the greateſt part of it into the lower Belly, it is thrown up the next day by vomit. Another proof that the heat is greater than naturally it ought, is not only the heat which the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties feel, but the immediate relief they find by taking cold things. <hi>Diocles</hi> adds, that ſome hold that in theſe diſtempers the orifice of the Stomach, which is joined to the Guts, is in flamed, and that this inflamation cauſes the obſtruction, and hinders the aliments from deſcending in due time into the Guts, and that by their ſtop the inflation of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, the heat, and other ſymptoms before mention'd are occaſioned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Diocles</hi> had a peculiar opinion of Fevers. We muſt judge, ſays he, of things which we cannot ſee, by thoſe which we can ſee; we obſerve that external inflamations, abſceſſes and wounds are attended by Fevers, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when a Fever takes any body, though we cannot externally diſcover any abſceſs, wound, or inflamation, we muſt however believe that there is ſome ſuch thing within the body.</p>
                     <p>His practice was much the ſame with that of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> He blooded and purged after the ſame manner, and upon the ſame occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. His particular method in every diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per may be ſeen in<note n="(e)" place="margin">Acuti Paſſ. l. 3 c. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>Caelius Aurelianus.</hi> The ſame Author reports, that <hi>Diocles</hi> cauſed all thoſe that were troubled with the Iliack paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſwallow a Leaden Bullet, a Medicine of which I find no mention in <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and which might perhaps be of <hi>Diocles</hi>'s own invention.
